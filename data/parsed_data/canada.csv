1.  How much of this ""hatred of whites"" do you actually experience in real life as opposed to being something you see in the media, social or otherwise?

2.  Are you actively searching out anti-white content either directly or through participation in online communities which dredge it up for you e.g. /r/tumblrinaction, /r/cringeanarchy, /pol/ etc?

These types of things can give you a seriously warped view on how other people are thinking.  I can tell you that I have a large diverse, socially liberal group of friends, attended a liberal school for four years, and participate in socialist organizing and I have never once had someone directly attack me based on my race/gender.  Still there was a time in my life when I remembered thinking this would be very common mainly because of participation in toxic online communities which encouraged me to think of myself as a victim.

The irony is the mindset you have adopted is actually very similar to that of so-called SJWs.  Adopt a victim mentality and than activelly dredge up things that confirm this bias.  Just like them you are convinced society and major institutions are against you all based on isolated examples which you activelly seek out and just like them you blame whole demographics of people for the toxic actions/words of a few.

You have it too, given your claim that immigration improves GDP. The neutral claim in this case would be that immigration doesn't affect GDP growth.

&gt;Why do you keep repeating this nonsense?

Because it isn't. Learn some economics. Asia went from being just Australia and New Zealand's fledgling economies to a powerful economic region on par with Europe. It would be absolutely retarded to not want to tap into it. To do so you need to be able to trade in that Ocean, and Vancouver is the best town to do so.

&gt;From where in Canada was the vast majority of the population of the city going to come from?

Well, let's see... anywhere where they felt the advantages of moving to a large growing town outweighed staying where they are. Internal migration does occur, it's not like people literally never move once their family lives in an area.

&gt;Do you have evidence that large percentage of the population of the city is directly involved in primary or even secondary import and export activities?

http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/data/statistics/employment-labour/labour-market-statistics

&gt;Does it seem odd to you that every other major port on the north American Pacific coast has a massive immigrant population?

Such towns do, because they're easily accessible and have a large number of low skill and high paying jobs for them to work because of the shipping yards, so there's incentive to stay there or move there once they arrive. Yeah, that pre-existing business sure does draw in people...

&gt;Assertion isn't a substitute for good reasoning.

True, which is why I've linked evidence and posted conclusions that can be drawn from the evidence.

The First Special Service Force aka the Devil's Brigade / the Black Devils was the unified Canadian and American commando force who were created to fill the need of mountaineering and night patrol missions similar to the already created SAS in Britain. They recruited hunters, forestry workers, mountaineers and others with pioneer type backgrounds and then trained them in night tactics, small arms, independent tactics, hand-to-hand combat. This unit was the precursor to the Green Berets, Rangers and our airborne units (with traditions eventually leading to JTF). This unique unit had shared command from both countries and the experiences of both countries (and from British advisors) resulted in a commando doctrine that influenced special forces today. 

In Operation Husky they first saw action in a battle that required them to scale a steep mountainside where they surprised the German defenders and had to fight off counter attacks while advancing uphill. Later in the campaign they became infamous among the Germans for night patrols where they would leave behind calling cards with dead sentries designed to terrify them. That is when they became known as ""the black devils"" as they would camouflage their faces by blackening them.

This was a pretty good collection of oral histories from veterans of the campaign. https://www.amazon.ca/Black-Devil-Brigade-Special-Service/dp/0935553509

independent growers.

Again ... so? The Canadian government can talk reparations and shift responsibility for things like health care or self governance to these indigenous nations, but the average citizen doesn't have to give one raging red fuck about any of it. In fact, the average citizen might very well be happy that these transitions are happening, so that any ties between Canada and these other nations get largely severed, so that we can move forward without the ongoing encumbrances. Like I said, you can make governments honour treaties, but you can't make individual people give a shit about you and yours.

&gt; And yet, Germany paid reparations to Israel for decades after the Holocaust ended.

True, but Germany did cause a massive world war that cost a few hundred million people their lives, and also put into place a systemic factory system to murder millions of people, wholesale. The scale of their infringement is just a tiny bit larger than Canada's.  Again, though, even if Canada pays these reparations, the average citizen doesn't have to (and largely doesn't) give a fuck about the status of the language, culture and people in those other nations. 

Either there's future division between the indigenous nations and Canada, and then Canada doesn't have to do things like mention treaties in our citizenship oath, maintain a Ministry of Indigenous Affairs, subsidize APTN, subsidize education, provide health benefits, etc., or they mold into Canada.  As long as there's this push to claim independent nation status when it suits, and national benefits within Canada when IT suits, you're going to get pushback. Pick one.

There are several types of FGM. The types most people immediately think of are as you describe - objectively different from male circumcision, and much worse.

There are other types that aren't different, and aren't worse, though. There's one sort that's removal of the clitoral hood only, which is exactly analogous to removal of the foreskin.

There are other types of FGM that are actually far less drastic than male circumcision. One, for example, involves a ""ceremonial pinprick"" or ""ceremonial scrape"" where a very small poke or scratch is done just to draw a drop of blood.

Nevertheless, people lump all FGM together under ""FGM"", and bans on the practice prohibit all sorts.

There are two ways to make things fair. Either we specifically prohibit the ""bad FGM"" and allow the ""less bad FGM"", or we extend the same sort of outrage and legislation to male circumcision as we already have for *all* FGM (both the severe types and the less severe ones).

&gt;The operational realities of military life mean that service members are often held to a higher standard of conduct than what would be expected of a civilian. Because military personnel are often required to risk injury or death in the performance of their duties, both inside and outside of Canada, the military justice system puts a premium on the necessity for discipline and for cohesion of military units.

&gt;Even though members of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) are held to the highest standards of conduct, they do not give up the rights that are afforded to them under Canadian law, including under the Constitution.  Nonetheless, an individual’s rights can be limited where they are inconsistent with the basic obligations of military service.  The Charter of Rights and Freedoms (Charter) – as part of Canada’s Constitution – has primacy over the NDA and all other laws of Canada. However, section 1 of the Charter explicitly permits other Charter rights to be limited under certain circumstances.

One- and two-bedroom condos are absolutely the type of home the 'normal working class' would buy, but the prices of even those are being inflated hugely because of rampant speculation, unit hoarding, AirBNB full-time rentals and the like.

If a party is totally dependent on their income coming from the government (let's say based on their % of votes in the previous election), this is very fair to established parties, but it prevents new parties from ever breaking into the game. On the other hand, if foreigners can donate money or if Canadians can donate an infinite or excessively large amount, then it gives a very significant advantage to the rich and/or those with foreign interests.

there's a distinction to be made between the two but it's not as though they're totally separate and never interact. the surgeries are just for those trans people that want to bring their bodies more in line with their identity; not all trans people get surgery--some can't afford it or don't have access, some don't care for the results, some don't want to take the risk, and some may feel that hormones alone are enough. so in that sense some *do* simply ""identify as the sex they identify with"" (either with just hormones, or by just transitioning socially--i.e. living as a man/woman as much as they're able to without medical intervention). there's a myriad of reasons they might do this.

This way people can jump ridiculously long wait times for MRI's and by doing so they actually help lower the waiting times for the public waiting list by enabling the purchase of more machines that will be 50% serving public wait lists.

(Props to her though because it was a tough situation and every frame had the beating in it somewhere.) I have only seen this done with a few other videos - notably Zapruder and Rodney King. Both times they were done by hand. 

While doing it, I figured I could cobble together some scripting that would make it go faster by letting you pick the control point and at least one horizontal or vertical line on each frame. That would give you enough information for a single translation and a rotation, which is all that I did in Gimp. It's always a good idea to do it the hard way once before you write software. Maybe next time, I will hack something together. The panorama software called Hugin has shown that one can find similar features in different images automatically (as well as correcting for lens effects) so it should be possible to do this completely in software with current know-how. 

As it was, each second of video took me about one hour to edit. It's fiddly work as well; kind of like being at the optometrist (better or worse?) while adjusting each frame one pixel left/right/up/down or 0.1 degrees clockwise or counter-clockwise.

Justice system sometimes makes mistake and convicts innocent people - keeping them alive sometimes allows those mistakes to be rectified.

It bolsters our system's reliability because if there are corrupted actors that are part of the system, they don't have a legal way to permanently remove a potential witness against them via state sanctioned execution.

Lessens viability of a lot of potential exploitative tactics that apply even in cases of people pleading guilty and testifying to a crime. For example - far riskier to blackmail a person into falsely taking the blame for something by threatening family, when you know you will have to keep that person fearful and compliant for a long time, vs for a few months until they get executed.

Relative to population, Asians are actually overrepresented, but they focus on absolute numbers because the fact that most people in Canada are white lets them paint a misleading picture that tech must be a white boys club.  It would break their minds that their logic would actually point to the conclusion it's an Asian mens club.

If there is a problem in tech, from what I can see, it's widespread misogynist views on women and supremacist views of men.  This is a culture strongly connected to gaming culture, also infamously misogynistic, and a group of people practically stereotyped as being bad with women and having little interaction with the opposite sex. Even so, if tech really fixed all its issues with women, I do not genuinely think there would be a 1:1 ratio of men and women in tech unless you forced both genders to do jobs they did not want to do, as it seems fairly self-evident to me that women are more interested in empathising type jobs and men more in systemising type jobs.  Nonetheless, I believe gender is an issue in tech.  

Race really is not.  It's absolutely a bullshit lie being pushed because somebody cannot help but see the world through an ideological filter.  If you work in the field and you're a racist you will drive yourself goddamned nuts because of the multiracial workforce.  Tech is ALREADY diverse, if diverse means white people aren't working in it, and the only underrepresented groups really are Hispanics, Aborigionals, and Blacks, but of course, that must mean that while everybody else is treated fairly, these three groups must be treated with racism.  It couldn't be in any way connected to some of these groups coming from cultures less tightly connected to computing relative to the three races overwhelmingly over represented on the pacific, the tech hub of the world, while living in cities with good internet access.  That if you truly want a more diverse workforce, you need to stop going after the not racist at all employers, stop blaming them for the problem, and simply promote computers to groups who simply have not had as much experience with them.

I'm not saying any of these because I fear the ""white boys club"" is gonna be broken up, it's that Asians, who are in tech because of interest and merit, are going to be thrown under the bus for the sake of somebodies diversity agenda, because if they're overrepresented they must have done something evil and wrong according to diversity think.  Because in some racists minds, if we don't have equal outcomes, some racial group must have done something evil to undermine peoples equal opportunity, and we must correct for this by discriminating against any racial group that is successful, and we call that ""diversity"" and ""political correctness"".

8626,"&gt;re prohibitions: fine then let's un ban all drugs ... not just pot ... why stop there after all?

Yes, that's what they've done in Portugal and Germany and Holland, and a few other places. It's been shown time and time again, the prohibition of drugs causes more problems than the drugs themselves. Overdoses, and side effects like losing all your hair and teeth, etc are caused by dirty impure drugs. Violence is caused by dealer's turf wars. Addicts steal to feed their habit because the prices are inflated astronomically by the black market. Heroin actually has no real side effects on the body, you could do heroin every day for the rest of your life and pretty much the worst that would happen is you'd get constipated. Meth is safe enough under a doctor's supervision that we currently prescribe it to children as young as six. The drugs don't cause any of the problems you associate with drug use. The prohibition causes all of these problems.

Have you studied anything about the prohibition of alcohol in the 1920's? As soon as alcohol was made illegal, huge violent criminal gangs popped up, making millions of dollars off the black market. Alcohol consumption went *UP*, showing that the threat of punishment did not discourage anyone from using it, in fact it only popularized it. People died from improperly distilled alcohol, or alcohol that was contaminated with other liquids - people would add antifreeze to gin to make an extra buck, just like dealers cut heroin with clorox today. The prohibition caused astounding amounts of violence, crime, and deaths, while alcohol use rose considerably. As soon as prohibition was ended, many cartels disbanded, alcohol use dropped, violent crime dropped, and people stopped being poisoned by bathtub gin. Likewise, in any country where drugs have been legalized and regulated, use has dropped, violence has dropped, crime has dropped, overdose deaths have dropped, HIV and other bloodborne disease transmission rates have dropped. 

It's not a matter of ""different cultures do things differently"", it's retardedly obvious that the black market causes all these multitudes of problems, which we spend billions each year fighting. Problems we created in the first place. In the early part of the century anyone could go to the drug store and buy all the cocaine or heroin they wanted, and while yes, there were some people who struggled with addiction, we never had any of the street violence and people breaking into cars and overdose victims dying on the streets that we have now.

You are also talking about private, top-tier universities in America. I am not. I am talking about the average, huge college in the US compared to a university in Canada. Especially a province like Ontario. You need a minimum of a B average just to be looked at for any university in Toronto. You also need to know exactly what you want to do from the 11th grade. Pick a wrong course? Sorry, no program admittance. Good luck getting in University of Toronto for a difficult program with less then a 90 percent average. I also suggest looking up how our percentage based system compared to that in the US. A B average here is an A average there. Which is why international universities require LOWER grade average from students who transfer from Canada (like Ontario), then the states.

My opinion of Green Party tinfoilness aside, this is a really misleading and inaccurate analysis.  

When comparing two sources of EM radiation, you can't just compare the total power of the two.  The reason is that the vast vast majority of the Sun's power output comes from frequencies far higher than WiFi frequencies (which is in the GHz range, typically 2.4 GHz).  In fact to get an exact look, check out the [solar spectrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Solar_Spectrum.png).  To find out exactly how the sun's output changes with frequency, check out [blackbody radiation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackbody_radiation).  You'll find the intensity of the sun's rays drop off quickly as you move away from the visible spectrum.  You can even calculate exactly how much power the earth recieves from the sun around the 2.4 GHz that WiFi operates at.  I won't do the integral because it's 10:30 and I'm a little drunk.  But suffice to say it won't be anywhere close to the '6 orders of magnitude greater' you quoted.

Now obviously we've evolved in such a way that the total 1700 W/m^2 of solar irratidation doesn't kill us, but that doesn't mean that a lesser total amount of radiation focused at one specific frequency won't be harmful.  That being said, any high school physics student can tell you that E=hv, meaning the higher frequency the EM radiation hitting you the more likely it is to fuck you up.  The bulk of the photons coming from the sun are have 1000 times as much energy as those from WiFi, not to mention they are way more populus.

So Tl;dr: Is WiFi going to give us cancer?  No, probably not.  That being said, don't use shit science to combat shit science.",canada

One might go into a convenience store to buy a single bag of milk and between leisurely locating the milk, taking a minute to remember if anything else needs to be bought, glancing around at the other merchandise on the way, and cashier not being in a hurry that single errand can stretch to 5 minutes even without any interruptions. 

Add a line of one person, and we are into risk territory given that in direct sunlight, air inside of a car can heat up by 20 degrees in 10 minutes on a mild day (24C temperature).

10 minutes is about how long an average person who doesn't think there is reason to hurry would take in a bathroom after they stopped at a gas station.

A mild accident like the person slipping in the store, or even someone engaging them in conversation for a few minutes can add several minutes unto an initially poor estimate of how long one will be away.

And kids can get pretty engrossed in video games while heat is one of those things that can sneak up on your brain without triggering any alarms if you are busy with something else.

edit: second issue here is that people rely on measures like cracked windows or even fully open windows but they don't realize how much wind speed and direction matters for that to make a difference. One could open all 4 windows fully and think the car is safe for a quick shopping trip but than a cloud moves out of the sunlight, wind dies down or changes direction and the cooling effect from the windows becomes negligible, while the car's body is still cooking.

Sort of like opening the door in your oven doesn't make the inside of that oven safe for your kids to climb in. ",canada

No it's far, far, less than that and also he had nowhere near a majority or even equal share when he left. As I said in my original comment:
&gt;worth *less than* a tenth [emphasis added]

He left in Q1 2008 it's first major investment was in 2013 Q3 at $70million for 5%. That's a valuation of $1.4 billion but that's also nearly 5 years after he left. It was also a cash infusion value/expansion investment of seed capital not a buyout. That money was part of what helped them grow to a billion.
So 5 years before that (considering he left before they made any of the agressive multimedia moves) it was probably worth still 10x less than that or according to his cofounder about not following Gavin's plan ""we would still be 8 people in a Williamsburg loft"". That's when Gavin left. He walked away from a de versification strategy that made everyone else billionaires. He walked away before they diversified and thus before they started making any real money. 2007-2008 was when the first started explosive growth rather than the slow growth they had in the 90's-mid 00's while he was around. It was likely closer to 100 or 200 mil at most...which isn't bad but considering he wasn't even close to being the majority owner and he pissed a lot of it away on failed ventures since...

The target was a person visiting them that day who the IDF claims was in Hamas's military wing.

The Boyat in UAE are women who are extreme tomboys with a penchant for military themed clothing. They often switch between roles of what is traditionally considered a woman and boyah by just taking off their abaya.

The Balkans have [Sworn Virgins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sworn_virgin), women who fill male gender roles and will not marry.

The [Muxe](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/07/weekinreview/07lacey.html) of Mexico are males who feel they identify more with being a female, and are okay in what is considered kind of an intolerant country for deviant sexualities.

In Sambia, there are different types of men- those who need semen from other males in order to become men, those who donate it to others so the male essence can be passed on, and those who no longer participate in the rituals.

The Navajo used ""nadleeh"" to refer to ""masculine feminine-bodied"" and ""feminine masculine-bodied"", which is can be as confusing as it sounds, related to two-spirited. In fact, most aboriginal cultures had more than two sexes and genders.

An Anishnabe tale tells of how man lived apart from each other and alone, so the Creator made sex pleasurable to bring them together, that they would desire sex, it would make them feel good and increase the population.

In Ancient Greece, however, lines were muddied based on social status and power. While not traditionally different ""genders"", there were certainly enforced rules to treat them wildly differently. For example, an Aristocratic male could have sex with a boy, but not another man's wife.

The [hijra](http://www.pbase.com/maciekda/hijras) of south asia are men who dress and act like women, with feminine gender roles, but identify as neither. There's quite a large amount of them, really, they're even mentioned in the Kama Sutra.

Either way, right now principle residences are exempt from capital gains tax which is a HUGE boon to property owners.

21115,"Adding on to this comment, as a Gen-X'er in Alberta who hangs out on the golf course with many baby boomers who made their wealth in O&amp;G, I can tell you that out here the vitriol for Trudeau is a double barreled shotgun of ""He's a Liberal"" and ""Son of the Great Evil Pierre Trudeau"".   When Justin Trudeau forgot to mention Alberta in his Canada Day speech... OH BOY was there ever a field day with that one, and it just reinforced what so many Albertans already think and feel.

I'm very liberal minded and depending on my mood and how well my game is going that day, sometimes I'll playfully get into it with the Trudeau haters.  But for the OP, and many other Canadians outside of Alberta, they need to realize some very important things:

* 1 [Pierre Trudeau's NEP of the 1980s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Energy_Program) was viewed as pure highway robbery.  Quoting from the Wikipedia article on the NEP:

&gt; ""the NEP was considered by Albertans to be among the most unfair federal policies ever implemented. Scholars calculated the program cost Alberta between $50 and $100 billion.""  

Can you imagine what the political environment would be like if this happened to Quebec?

* 2 Historically, due to population distributions in Canada where Quebec and Ontario hold the lions share of population, Alberta has always felt ""we"" are subjugated by the East, and those governments have overwhelmingly been Liberal governments. 

* 3  Feeding into #2, Alberta's contribution to the federal equalization payments have been a constant point of contention, especially given how little say Alberta has traditionally had in the Federal government.  [Between 2000 and 2014, on a net basis, Alberta’s individual and corporate taxpayers shipped an estimated $200 billion-plus to the federal government. That’s what left the province, less what the feds reinvested.](http://edmontonjournal.com/opinion/columnists/gary-lamphier-how-much-money-has-flowed-out-of-alberta-to-ottawa-a-lot)

21138,"&gt; Considering he not only confessed to torturing a different inmate, but also had complete immunity for his treatment of Khadr, he has zero reason to lie.

It has nothing at all to do with lying and everything to do with the legal definition and interpretation of events differing from the personal definitions of a biased actor involved in those events. Think of waterboarding, and how the Bush government lobbied that it wasn't torture, but the UN and US courts ultimately ruled it was, as an example. The Bush administration legal opinion ultimately didn't mean much.

&gt; Irrelevant. We're talking about his conviction and confession - which he agreed to with his plea deal outside of Gitmo.

It's not irrelevant at all.  He had to agree to that plea deal to even get OUT of Gitmo, and his treatment while at that facility most definitely informs and motivates his plea as a result.  Anyway, what you and I say here really means shit.  It's all going to come down to a US judge in a US courtroom, and to date those cases haven't gone the way of the US government very often.

&gt; One US judge has already ruled the confessions admissible

One MILITARY judge, based out of Guantanamo Bay, using the Military Commissions Act as his body of law, sure, but part of the contention in the appeal is that the standard of justice in the tribunals was insufficient and ultimately unfair, prompting him to plead just to get away from that unfair body of law and that detention.

imho A big factor with regards to Chinese investment is this:

[New visa rules will take China-Canada relations to a new level](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/new-visa-rules-will-take-china-canada-relations-to-a-new-level/article23354909/)

&gt; With this arrangement, visa offices in China and Canada will issue to citizens – for business travel, tourism or family visits – multiple-entry visas that are valid for up to 10 years, but not exceeding validity of applicant’s passport. Each stay may not exceed 180 days.

&gt;This arrangement is another remarkable achievement in the development of bilateral relations between China and Canada.

&gt;When Prime Minister Stephen Harper visited China last November, a broad consensus was achieved regarding politics, the economy and people-to-people exchanges. 

Australia has something similar.  It's clear that western trade with China isn't going away any time soon.  Parties say that they want it to slow down, but the reality is they all want it to pick up.  Why?  Duh... Money.  *Money, money, money, money, money.*

fwiw, Canadians can also travel quite freely to China as well, as part of the agreement.

2) The 'it' refers to the Australian system of being solely an Australian citizen and they prefer this compared to the American system of being born in the country.

Both system they prefer instead of a requirement of being born in the country.  So asking why they think being born in Canada would be a good rule is misintepreting what they said.

Peter MacKay - lawyer for a steel company, appointed Minister of Defense (never served in the military) and Minister of Foreign Affairs
Tony Clement - lawyer, appointed President of the Treasury Board	(no degree in economics or finance) and Minister for the Federal Economic Development Initiative for Northern Ontario (represents southern ontario riding, never lived in N. Ontario).

Nope, the people choose the MP's, not the government, that's a pretty important distinction.

The police will always arrest someone who has apparently shot an intruder, or used a firearm to defend their property. The investigation follows and depending on the circumstances the crown prosecutes or drops charges. Think about it from a law enforcement perspective, can you let someone go free who has allegedly shot another person without an investigation?  

People have had charges dropped, and sometimes the charges are lessened. Depending on the firearm used, and it's legal status might result in unsafe storage charges or something similar. You can't legally have a loaded pistol in your side table, or conceivably use a restricted firearm based on storage laws. (Get a short non restricted shotgun for home defense) . And if the gun is illegally owned you're in big trouble regardless. 

You'll be prosicuted if warning shots are used, like a guy in my neighborhood who shot out at the dark and left holes in people's houses to scare off an attacker. I don't care about defending your house, you can't accedently shoot someone in bed. 

The most important thing that needs to be revealed in an investigation is if the use of force was appropriate. If you're safety isn't being threatened you can't shoot.

Detainee, though only 16 years old at the time of his travel to Afghanistan, has been found to be intelligent and educated and understands the gravity of his actions and affiliations. Detainee excelled at his training in Afghanistan, which included small arms, explosives training, IEDs, mines, mine laying, and configuring IEDs for remote detonation using hand held devices. Detainee admits to having participated in several mining operations and harassing attacks against US Forces, in addition to throwing the grenade that killed a US solider. Detainee has never expressed any genuine remorse for the killing of that soldier. He has direct family affiliations with senior Al-Qaida members, has received advanced specialized training in explosives, and has directly participated in hostile attacks against US Forces. Detainee claims that his entire family lived at one of Usama Bin Laden's compounds in Jalalabad, AF. Detainee continues to provide valuable information on his father's associates, and on non-governmental organizations that he worked with in supporting Al-Qaida, as well as other major facilitators of interest to the US. Detainee has also provided valuable information on the Derunta, Al-Farouq and Khalden training camps, indicating that the detainee has been to and likely trained at these locations; and he continues to provide valuable information on key Al-Qaida and Taliban members.

&gt;Apologies if I misread/misinterpreted your post.

This is always really nice to see on reddit, and I honestly, genuinely appreciate this.

So, Let's talk about this more.

Yeah, the group of people that forced the woman out of her position are absolutely wrong. I absolutely condemn that, and think it's an issue.

I don't think it's an issue with Islam specifically, or at least, Islam is no more of an issue to Muslims than Christianity is an issue to Christians in cases like this.

It hasn't been that long since [christians were doing the same kinds of things in canada](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/lgbtq-canada-class-action-1.4047232), but look at the progress we've made in such a short amount of time.

I don't think a gay wedding with an entire supportive muslim family could ever happen in the middle east. This is the effect of canadian culture. It's hard for first generation immigrants, and refugees to instantly assimilate, but there's no reason to believe that these kids growing up in Canadian schools with Canadian friends and holding Canadian values are going to hold on to these oppressive views.

Like, Imagine if we had a family move in from Saudi arabia, and the dad really didn't want his daughters to drive ever. How long do you think that would last? When that girl saw all of her friends driving, tons of women driving, and no issues, do you think she's going to hold on to that specific weird interpretation of her religion when she grows up? It seems crazy to me to even imagine she would.

And yes, I understand that integration is hard. And that stuff like this is going to happen when we have a large influx people from countries like the ones in the middle east, but [we are helping](http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-yazidi-family-plea-son-freed-isis-1.4212327).

Muslim countries typically are not secular and so the religion is also predominately the state. Yes, there are exceptions, but as a general rule of thumb there aren't really any ""Christian"" countries. 

Same with the death toll stat, all the countries you are calling ""Christian"" are in fact secular, so you can't blame the religion for their death toll.

Perhaps being arrested would be frightening enough to scare someone into not doing such a thing again, in which case an apology might be appropriate.  If there is doubt as to that, perhaps community service or a similar consequences would be appropriate - I know the Crown is empowered to make all sorts of deals, sometimes without requiring a guilty plea and therefore a criminal record.  If there is some other issue, such as mental health, that led to it, then I'd just be happy with an apology and them getting the help they need.

I think what we have to remember here is that although the charge is assault, no one was actually harmed.  What we are talking about is someone throwing a piece of pizza.  Even if it had hit, it wouldn't have hurt anyone.  At worst, it would have soiled his clothing.  Why do you want to wreck someone's life over this?",canada

Just because religious groups are kind of slimy in their reporting of adherents, that doesn't mean it makes sense for a parent to be able to vote for their child.

The difference isn't in the domain of political clout, but in the domain of childhood development. Some people believe that religion is an important part of a child's development, while others believe it is detrimental to the child. Children themselves cannot choose whether they want to be religious or not until they reach a certain age, and defaulting to no religion *is* a choice.

How many people, if raised in the absence of religion (not on the fringe of religion while being told it is bad), would go on to choose it, barring a major traumatic experience?

Further, how do you regulate what parents are allowed to teach to children? What beliefs need to be held back until the child can choose for themself? Parents are going to pass certain beliefs onto their children. Those children can later reassess those beliefs to see if they agree with them.

Labour is a commodity like any other. For example, if Canada was a closed economy, I think we can both agree that the introduction of mass automation in industries that continue to be very human-heavy would concentrate wealth in the owners of that capital, all else being equal. Money must be transferred from the owners of that money to the factors of production (of which one is traditionally labour) in order to produce. I think we can also agree that labour is one of two primary ways that money is transferred from one person to another in this country, since labour is simply a special type of sale (and even then, not all that special--it's subject to the same forces as every other normal good).

So, my concern is not for the health of the Canadian economy as a whole, but for the economic health of the median citizen. Free trade widens the economic gap between the holders of capital and their means of production--in this case, Canadian business owners and Chinese employees, rather than the old relationship of Canadian business owners and Canadian employees.

Is it possible that newly unemployed Canadians will find themselves a place in the new Canadian economy under that arrangement? Of course. But Canada has a price floor for labour--the options are ""at least minimum wage"" or ""$0"", and China's average wage is between 1/5th and 1/14th of that price floor. So, failing some sort of massive demand for domestic labour in the Canadian economy that will be created under the arrangement (which I really don't see happening), I fail to see how higher profits for Canadian firm owners and lower prices for imported goods can benefit a Canadian that is now making $0.",canada

There is no ""malignancy of billionaires."" There's a massive issue with the government limiting working class access to work. 

Another comment I have related:

&gt;We should be removing barriers for wealth creation on the working class. Instead people who think their one economics class makes them an expert want to do the absolute stupidest thing and jack up taxes in the rich. News flash, Canada can not afford to cause a wave of capital flight. France did it and has been trying to reverse it, to little avail considering they're still bleeding wealth. And that will come back to bite in the future. 

&gt;You know how you make income inequality worse? Do things that makes the barrier to entry into the economy harder for people, e.g. absurd minimum wage hikes to buy votes. Rather hilariously, and sadly since no one bothers to look, most of the people working minimum wage jobs are not actually the poor parents trying to feed their kids. Most are teenagers and college/university students, who tend to be dependents in a household already not poor. Or it's 20 somethings starting out in the work force, a minimum wage job is normal, and often older semi-retired people wanting a supplemental income or treating boredom. Poor people often have no reliable work, and a higher minimum wage **will** make their chances of getting work lower; or people who already make ~acceptable money, but are being crushed by debt/other responsibilities (like injury or addiction problems).

&gt;Bring in poor immigrants quite obviously does nothing to help, and companies are hardly going to do more low level work *in* Canada that can give a stable income source to the lower/lower middle class with high corporate taxes, astoundingly dumb utilities costs, etc. 

&gt;Our poorly convinced tax and welfare systems don't help to much either. Welfare systems **need** to be structured in a way that at least somewhat encourages working to get off of it. A negative income tax with entitlements clawed back over time at a lower, reasonable amount wouldn't be bad. Claw back benefits every 6 months that a person doesn't work (unless unable because of injury/disability, or occupied in education/job training).

Take the various Islamic extremist factions to have cropped up in the last 15-20 years. Most of them, if they could get away with it, would have absolutely no problem whatsoever with bringing their backwards thinking to Canada. Were it not for the fact we are extremely fucking lucky insofar as geography goes, they'd have very likely tried by now (see also: Europe). That same backwards thinking sees things like the charter as entirely incompatible, and would set it on fire if that was all it would take to render it useless.

We are never going to be directly in the line of fire just on basic principle, given our geographic location and the fact if anyone wanted to aim at North America they'd likely aim at the US. But we value the exact same rights, more or less, as places like the UK. Much in the same way that we shouldn't be okay with rights being violated in Canada, we should be equally not okay with rights being violated in allied countries, or countries under our protection. Unfortunately, that's going to mean getting our hands dirty.

The long and short of it is they're called *international* human rights for a reason. The charter is just Canada's attempt at carrying out those rights--which is how free speech laws in Canada become significantly different from those in the US, despite both countries having the right to free speech.

TL, DR: No international human rights, no charter. No enforcement, no international human rights.

My view is that the best taxation scheme is one that takes more from those that have it than from those that don't, and provides assistance to those who need it rather than those who don't.

Inheritance style taxes are exactly this kind of tax.  People with poor parents don't have to think about this tax because they can't expect their parents to give them anything.  People with rich parents are affected because their parents are rich enough to give them something.  Rather than inheriting 100% of the value their parents will them, they may only inherit 85% of it.  That seems perfectly fair.

There may be a rare situation where the only thing someone inherits is a property, like a cottage, and no money at all.  In that situation, the only way to pay the taxes is to sell the property, or to take out a reverse-mortgage on it to try to pay off the taxes.  Even then, that person is inheriting something of value and paying only a small amount of taxes in that exchange.  While I have sympathy for that person if they have an emotional attachment to the property, it's still one of the better forms of taxation.",canada

For example, people today want MRIs, which are safe (no ionizing radiation) but require massive capital purchases. The entire healthcare sector had digitized, and though it raised efficiency it involved a massive capital outlay, and expensive maintenance costs. Not to mention baby boomer generation retiring needed increased healthcare.

China and Russia for example has broken international law, and look, China is still an economic powerhouse, and Putin is still in power. Nothing happened. Those sanctions they placed did nothing to stop China or Russia. China is only kept in-check because of the US alliance in Asia, and Russia is kept in-check because of NATO. There's none of this compassion and empathy crap. 

I will consider international law effective only if China's expansion to the South China Sea is completely stopped and reserved, and Russia's annexation of Crimea is reversed, both were clear violations of international law, and the world did nothing to stop it.

&gt;I don't think deficits are over sold as a concern. If I run continued deficits in my business, I will go out of business. We are not in dire economic times right now and it makes no sense to be racking up debt.

The topic is massively oversold, the government isn't a business. The key reason people are over concerned is they have no idea why that's important. It prints it's own money, most of the debt is owed to it's own people. A government can print more, devaluing their currency to cover debts. There is limits to this and it causes problems but not at the levels of debt we're in. 

The problem with excessive debt is difficulty in getting more borrowers. But that line is much higher than our current debt levels. We're at about 80% gross government debt to GDP, Japan is over 230%, the US over 100%. We have to be in so much debt that there are concerns about our ability to pay it. That threshold is way higher than were we're at.

I feel like the OP's argument here is about NA natives and what they accomplished as a people/culture **on their own**.  You could argue that them migrating across the ice sheets from Asia during the last ice age was an accomplishment and is, however once they got here it seems like the status quo for NA natives was just to migrate around following the food source and never really growing as a culture (I guess we have a different idea of what growing is).  Now compare that to the Mayans who accomplished architecture, mathematics, a calendar, and astronomical system.  I'd agree with what the OP has said comparatively to some native cultures around the world they pretty much stayed hunters and gathers something that humans have been doing for probably 100k's of years while other cultures seemed to have grown without the help of Europeans on their own naturally.

I'm circumcised, and i think it's unnecessary. My parents did it at my grandpa' insistence, because he got an infection and got circumcised when he was 13, and said it was incredibly painful and humiliating, and didnt want it to happen to me or my brothers. 

Having said that, i really dont think it's necessary, and shouldnt be practiced anymore these days.  But i don't really feel bad for having it done one way or the other.

&gt;I have a cell phone through Rogers.  One day I get a call from a Rogers store in Brampton and the clerk is telling me there is a girl posing as my girlfriend trying to charge an iPhone to my account.  I told him she was a fake and that I’m the only user with permissions on my account.  I call up Rogers and tell them somebody is trying to defraud me and to put a freeze on and activity on my account outside of regular billing. 

&gt;One week later my phone suddenly switches to SOS mode with no warning.  I was on my way to Toronto for the day so I didn’t deal with it until I got back later that evening.  I eventually call their customer service line and they tell me my plan has been switched over to my iPhone.  I tell them I don’t have an iPhone and why didn’t you guys stop this from happening when I warned you one week ago.  To cut a long story short they sent my “case” off to the wrong department and never did anything about this bitch trying to steal from me.  I was refunded but still had to deal with the hassle and incompetence.

Story 2:
&gt;I switched my plan to a cheaper version of itself (same basic features but updated and saves about $20/mo).  After a month I get a $515 phone bill because they had my evenings starting at 9pm when I explicitly said I wanted evenings to start at 6pm for the extra $5-7 fee.  Rather than look into it the rep accuses me of lying to him because I’m probably wrong and just trying to get one over on them.  After I protest he goes and checks the phone logs and says to me “oh, I guess you were telling the truth.”

The first issue is pretty easy to understand, Netflix isn't currently required for its library to carry a certain percentage of Canadian content, and they aren't required to help fund Canadian content creation.

The second issue is also easy to understand. Obviously as a strictly internet based company they have no need to build their own infrastructure like the incumbents have. 

The third issue, and probably the biggest of them is that Netflix offers on-demand services, they don't just broadcast channels like the incumbents do, who supplement with on-demand channels. Everyone in Canada would LOVE ""a la carte"" programming, where you only pick the channels you want, but that isn't economically feasible for these companies, which is why you have to buy a basic line-up and then get extra packages. Netflix can bypass this because they only license specific shows, and do not license network access and the content that comes with that network.

There has to be a thousand reasons to be against them.  One of their correspondents is a plagiarist.  Another correspondant rushed the stage at a play.  A former correspondant got arrested blocking a refugee ship.  Levant has been successfully sued for libel when that's a very high standard to meet.  The clickbait.  The divisive rhetoric.  The constant stunts.  The overall inanity of their political leanings.  Their extremist anti-Islam rhetoric, given while they're not antisemetic, they are DEFINITELY anti-Islam. 

Yet people keep coming back to this idea that the Rebel is so antisemetic and it's absolutely bizarre to me.  It has to be pretty much the weakest possible way people commonly attack the Rebel.  It is one thing they are not.  Anti-Semites denounce The Rebel as lugenpresse that is an example of the Jewish conspiracy to take over both sides of the media, which push pro-Israel rhetoric wrapped in a message appealing to the right wing, often saying they're libertarian Canadians that are much too centrist on top of that.  

Antisemites hate them because they know that The Rebel is dangerous to the cause of antisemitism. They are a cannon against antisemitism, because they're not people worried about appearing politically correct to virtue signal, they don't care about crossing uncrossable lines like how you're never ever allowed to say something critical of Jews, allowing them to actually get through to confused young men, and push a resoundingly pro-Jewish message, because they're willing to cross lines that will make these alt-right guys actually listen to them.

I really cannot think of many more effective organisations against antisemitism than The Rebel, certainly they're more effective than every liberal organisation at countering antisemetic propaganda, and it never ceases to outstand me how people can be so blind to not understand what they are doing.  They just look at how some antisemites watch The Rebel, they see some clickbait videos, and that's all they need to know, just look skin deep and write them off as antisemites.  If there is one virtuous thing about The Rebel its that they make pro-semetic causes look cool to the right wing anti-PC crowd.

This isn't some negligence case where there's blame apportioned out as a percentage of some total loss, it's direct compensation for the specific violations committed by our government.

Not true at all. Many of these cases involved third parties who were partly or largely responsible. It's hard to envision someone saying that when a man is falsely imprisoned for murder, the actual murderer is not responsible in large degree for what happened to him, as he obviously would not have ended up in jail had that person not committed the murder, but that is totally irrelevant to the fact that the government is the one who violated his rights by falsely imprisoning him, and that's what the payout is for.

Ok you lost me here. How is this at all a good ""indicator of what's going on""? You said yourself that people can no longer support themselves and their family in the current job market. I completely agree, jobs are flowing out of Canada thanks to corporate monopolies and outsourcing. The price of living skyrocketed in recent decades and wages can not rise in accordance. Race has jack shit to do with any of this. Canadians are being forced ignore that the needs of international corporate entities are being placed before the needs of the Canadian people. ""breaking it down into race"" is a way to distract people from the real problems and get the population fighting amongst themselves. A perpetually divided nation will never be able to organise and ensure the ruling powers functions for the well being of the nation. An international corporate entity is not loyal to any one nation, their only interest is to ensure that the people of the nations in which they do business do not impede their means of profit. This ""diversity is a strength"" tripe being pushed on Canadians is a monument to this. Not only does the importation of low payed workers benefit corporate monopolies, it also further divides and ""diversifies"" the nation rendering it rudderless as it is occupied with the social disarray caused by lack of consensus and unity.

39041,"Quebec doesn't hate the rest of Canada.

And if you think Quebec's culture isn't different from the rest of the country you clearly didn't spend much time here.

I'm an Ontarian living in Quebec, and one of the things I've come to realize is that part of the Quebecois identity is an enormous cultural inertia. They don't want to be forced to become like the rest of the provinces, and want to keep to themselves and have people respect their culture and political stance while participating as they see fit in Confederation.  They also have tighter control over immigration, and much stronger laws regarding the use of their national language, which many people unfairly chalk up to racism (which it is not).

Quebec politics seems more left-leaning than the rest of the country (especially now), so often the opinions of Quebecois are at odds with those of the more Anglo provinces, and this creates tensions.  Quebec has higher taxes, but is also poorer, and due to its large population receives a large kickback in terms of equalization payments (though let's not forget that all that money comes from taxes paid by the provinces in the first place, and would be collected by the Feds regardless of whether it was used to pay provinces; it's just like income tax for individuals, but on a national level).    

There are also some things that it would seem Quebec is self-conscious about.  A classic example is the [rampant corruption and inefficiency in the construction industry](http://www.cyberpresse.ca/actualites/dossiers/crise-dans-la-construction/201106/26/01-4412751-corruption-et-collusion-plus-frequentes-quon-ne-croyait-dans-la-construction.php?utm_categorieinterne=trafficdrivers&amp;utm_contenuinterne=cyberpresse_BO2_quebec_canada_178_accueil_POS3).   This issue aside, Quebec tends to be quite sensitive to criticism from other provinces, and often invokes the term ""Quebec bashing"" when attacked (unjustly or not) by the Anglophone media.  Sometimes they're crying wolf, but it's also true that they get a lot of flak from the rest of the country simply for being different and somewhat separate.",canada

I'd have had to either be born in the United States or applied for US Citizenship before I could claim entitlements as a citizen, rather than applying for a visa. So no, it's not the case that I would get such an entitlement without doing anything, short of being born there.

&gt;You know what's unjust? Citizens of convenience using Canadian resources without ever having lived in Canada before.

Citizens of convenience don't live in Canada, so they're not getting entitlements from Canada if they don't live there. We've been over that. So besides protection of their basic human rights, they're not getting medicare, or welfare, or anything but the basic human rights protections that Canadian citizenship affords.

&gt;Do you suppose that any and all foreigners are entitled to citizenship? No? Then why should it be any different because they were born here?

I do in fact share Canada's own position on this matter: that anyone is entitled to obtain Canadian citizenship. In fact, pretty much the only way you aren't eligible for Canadian citizenship is [if you're guilty of a crime or had your citizenship revoked](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/citizenship/situations.asp).

You won't have enough time to make it out to the Maritimes. I think you might be underestimating how far some of these place are from each other. At best in the winter I would expect Detroit to Toronto to be 4 hrs not including the wait at the border. Here are some other driving times:

* Toronto/Hamilton to Ottawa is a 4hr drive
* Toronto/Hamilton to Montreal is a 6hr drive
* Montreal to Ottawa is a 2 hr drive
* Montreal to Quebec City is a 3 hr drive
* Montreal to Detroit is a 9hr drive

I think you should pick one city and do it well with the 6 days you have for your vacation. Considering that each day on either end is going to involve a lot of commuting you end up with 4 full days to explore to your hearts content. As others have said there isn't anything super spectacular about Hamilton. You'll find a lot more to do and see in Toronto. So if you are super into saving some money then spend your nights in Hamilton but your days exploring Toronto.

Another option would be to spend most of your time in a different city altogether - I personally would recommend Montreal. Stop off in Hamilton for lunch on your way to Montreal to visit the relatives. You can take a day trip to either Quebec City (my recommendation) or Ottawa on one of those 4 days that you have. I think you will find Montreal and Quebec City more different - that is more interesting then Toronto. Toronto is a lot like any other big city - but Montreal and Quebec City have their old historic towns which honestly are something to behold. You really can't find anything like it anywhere else in Canada or the US. Its like being transported to Europe - but better because they have poutine and maple syrup. On your way home, visit the relatives again :)

This is one of my favorites, often cited here in /r/Canada in some way:

To the extent that negative impacts occur, they are most likely to be found for prior immigrants or native-born workers who have not completed high school—who are often the closest substitutes for immigrant workers with low skills.
&gt;Evidence on the inflow of high-skilled immigrants suggests that there may be positive wage effects for some subgroups of native-born workers, and other, wider benefits to the economy more broadly.

How does this one happen then: [Average hourly wages in Canada have barely budged in 40 years](http://globalnews.ca/news/3531614/average-hourly-wage-canada-stagnant/)

As one of the most important cities in the Americas, Montreal was on the cutting edge of the popularization of professional sports in the later 19th century.

We had a summer Olympics (although we're not especially proud of that one).

A hockey riot in 1955 is considered to be a turning point in our history.

Historically the best team in hockey.

Jackie Robinson.

Finally (and this is just my personal opinion) I think Montreal's the best place in the world to watch soccer on TV.  Unlike most other North American cities, Montreal loves soccer.  Fans of every team in the world live here and no team or nation has preponderance.  During the World Cup, you can watch almost any national team at a bar where you'll be surrounded by people (and supporters) of that nation.  If you're a soccer fan, I recommend visiting us during the next World Cup.  Hell, visit us for the next El Classico.

If you have Shaw WideOpen with 150/15 Mbps down and up, that is considered your last mile connection from your ISP to you.  That connection is mostly what you pay for.  Your actual connection to the Internet (from the ISP to other ISPs, on what is called backhaul, trunk, or a few other things), is what that $3-5/Mbps pays for.

It's hard to calculate actually what it costs, because everyone shares that connection.  

Now if that Shaw Wideopen customer shares his connection with 10,000 other people, and the ISP has a 30 Gbps fibre connection to the next ""node"" for Internet, that means everyone is entitled to 3 Mbps, but because nobody ever uses their full connection (due to so many reasons, including protocols and physics), you can get up to 150 Mbps download.

Your portion of your bill for that 3 Mbps ""share"" costs the ISP around $15, but then another $30-40-ish for everything else (cable connection to home, install, upgrades, phone support, licensing, etc).

I used 3 Mbps, as if you download at full speed for 30 days, and upload at 1/10th that, then you can move a maximum of 1TB total data, which happens to be their data cap :)

*""The Aboriginal population of Canada during the late 15th century is estimated to have been between 200,000[10] and two million,[11] with a figure of 500,000 currently accepted by Canada's Royal Commission on Aboriginal Health.[12] Repeated outbreaks of Old World infectious diseases such as influenza, measles and smallpox (to which they had no natural immunity), were the main cause of depopulation. This combined with other factors such as dispossession from European/Canadian settlements and numerous violent conflicts resulted in a forty- to eighty-percent aboriginal population decrease after contact.[10] For example, during the late 1630s, smallpox killed over half of the Wyandot (Huron), who controlled most of the early North American fur trade in what became Canada. They were reduced to fewer than 10,000 people""*

The U.S. election night panel.  Ashleigh Banfield was right down the middle.  David Frum gave his intelligent, but quite obviously (and admittedly) biased take.  Meanwhile, Danielle Moodie-Mills, whoever she is, gave us the SJW, 'oppressed' Black person, unqualified-blogger perspective for three hours - saying all kinds of crazy shit, and Peter only once, *almost* challenged her on something.  

The most recent Ann Coulter interview.  Coulter can be abrasive, so it's not your typical interview, anytime, but Mansbridge again, let us all know again what he thinks.  The subject was mostly immigration.  Mansbridge got a tad bristly and perturbed at Ann's responses.

This has always been far more than a simple question of Omar Khadr's rights as a citizen, or his rights as a human being under international law.  This has been a test of the Canadian principles which underpin those rights, and whether or not those Canadians will uphold and defend those principles.

Khadr is a Canadian citizen.  He always has been.  What does that mean? Traditionally, that has meant that Khadr would be brought before a judge, formally presented with the crimes against him, granted access to competent legal council and permitted to defend himself against those charges.  Instead, Khadr was denied those rights, and he was tortured by the Americans, with his government's consent.  

Canadians have been debating whether they will have the courage to stand by our principles, when those principles are challenged ... or whether we'll abandon them easily, without resistance. For the sake of expediency. Out of fear. 

We defend our own rights, liberties, and dignity whenever we protect those who we may not even feel deserve them, especially those who are powerless to defend themselves.

&gt;She described herself having a sister with young children and another younger sister and brother. She told Hoffart on being questioned by him that she used to be an assistant buyer in Ontario and now she was “just finding a new place and other things”. JVV admitted that she had given the accused that answer as she did not want him to know that she was a young girl and she avoided further questions on that topic.

&gt;The accused specifically asked, (not relying on her web profile), at 7:40:31 on December 28th 2008, “Okay-I really need to ask this...How old are you?” JVV replied “y?” and the accused typed “I think I read you were 20?” to which JVV replied “Ya”- the accused “Okay - I just needed to know. If you were younger there’s no way in hel (sic) I’d be saying this :-p” and JVV replied “That’s good to know”. JVV acknowledged in cross-examination about this exchange, that she believed that if she told the accused she was fifteen she thought the conversations with him would stop and she liked them so she did what she could to keep them going.

&gt;  In perpetuation of the myth regarding her age, the complainant in her messages made reference to the fact that she was in a relationship with a man “twenty eight” and ongoing conversations with other men - “there’s three guys ‘breathing down my back’ to see me”. She made reference to cuddling up to “my beloved Mr.Bear” in the midst of a flirtatious exchange regarding her need for comfort as she was, at the same time as typing online, watching a scary movie and discussing a love poem sent to her by the accused. However, she then suggested “switching him (Mr. Bear) for the accused - a flirtatious or sexual turn on the use of the teddy bear, not a childish reference to still playing with teddy bears. She described herself as liking Tchaikovsky and listening to the Nutcracker in another exchange. The other men with whom she was conversing were described by her as being very disrespectful and sexually suggestive. She elicited considerable sympathy and indignation on her behalf from the accused, which she admitted to liking. Her discussions with him about her relationships involved a description of some that ended badly due to “being away from each other and drifting apart”. While she used type-written slang and text abbreviations and emoticons extensively, she was a poor speller. She recounted a story regarding a past relationship where “a couple of years ago I was sneaking out of my ex’s downstairs window ...”.  In another posting JVV described going out to get drunk and smoking. All of these references were consistent with her being the stated age of twenty. There were no references to parental supervision, school attendance, friendships or other young age appropriate activities, financial dependency or other youthful circumstances.

&gt;The accused asked JVV for a picture, “What do you look like?” and she appeared to have trouble posting one a number of times, then finally got a blurry one up which showed her wearing a bikini top and pants, but where her face was indistinct. A few days later he specifically asked her “what do you do anyway? I’ve never asked.” JVV did not provide that information, she just typed “nope” and “No specifics” and the accused backed off. He expressed that he was respectful of JVV’s need for privacy (in internet conversations). Eventually the accused asked to meet JVV sometime over a cup of coffee. She replied that she was very shy and then agreed but stated, “I mean we can, u know,..be together but not in this house - she would kill me”. The accused inquired, “Who’s she?”, and JVV answered “the person I’m staying with” and said “ u cant ask too many questions” - and “just to let u know, I really want to but im really nervous so ill be shy at first k?”  Before they made specific arrangements to meet, the accused gave her information in case she wanted to leave a note - “just in case”. He gave her his full name, address, phone number and vehicle description and licence plate. While the instructions for meeting were for him to pick her up at a gas station on the main road of the town, he did not think that odd as he had never been to her town and her arrangement to meet at a landmark made it easier to find her. The late hour was indicative of their mutual like of spontaneous activities. He did not think it was due to her need to sneak out. He also believed that meeting out of the house was to avoid disruption to JVV’s roommate. The complainant testified that she never knew much about the accused and particularly that she never knew his last name.

It seems like the guy actually gave a shit about making sure she was 20, and she went pretty far out of her way to keep him convinced that she was.

So take the time and write out your issue. It's worth noting that the article is about cell phone plans not internet but you and everyone else should take the time to complain about each element.       

If the CRTC releases their yearly complaint numbers and they go down each year it won't get much media coverage. If all of a sudden the numbers go up by 30-50% in one year imagine how much media coverage that will get?      
   
Look at the numbers from last year:    

Top 10 service providers by number of complaints

1. Bell Canada – 2,940 complaints – down 18.3 per cent year over year   
2. Rogers – 861 complaints – down 52.5 per cent   
3. Telus – 570 complaints – up 22.3 per cent   
4. Wind – 498 complaints – down 29.1 per cent   
5. Virgin Mobile – 497 complaints – down 18.3 per cent   
6. Fido – 453 complaints – down 25.4 per cent   
7. Videotron – 402 complaints – up 28.4 per cent   
8. Koodo – 207 complaints – up 18.3 per cent   
9. Xplornet – 188 complaints – up 86.1 per cent    
10. Comwave – 160 complaints – up 11.9 per cent    

Look at the numbers for just Rogers and Bell alone, there are more complaints in this thread than there are via the CRTC for all of last year.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayezid_II#Jewish_and_Muslim_immigration

&gt;In July 1492, the new state of Spain expelled its Jewish and Muslim populations as part of the Spanish Inquisition. Bayezid II sent out the Ottoman Navy under the command of admiral Kemal Reis to Spain in 1492 in order to evacuate them safely to Ottoman lands. He sent out proclamations throughout the empire that the refugees were to be welcomed.[6] He granted the refugees the permission to settle in the Ottoman Empire and become Ottoman citizens. He ridiculed the conduct of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile in expelling a class of people so useful to their subjects. ""You venture to call Ferdinand a wise ruler,"" he said to his courtiers, ""he who has impoverished his own country and enriched mine!""[7] Bayezid addressed a firman to all the governors of his European provinces, ordering them not only to refrain from repelling the Spanish refugees, but to give them a friendly and welcome reception.[7] **He threatened with death all those who treated the Jews harshly or refused them admission into the empire.**

Turkey sheltered many more Jewish people during WW2, as well. Albania was the only European country to have more Jews after WW2 than before, and it's a Muslim country.

see above for how i destroyed this dumb argument.. having bastardized cuisine and chinese/russian millionaires ramping up the price of our property does NOTHING to teach us about the world or make us more worldly, ONLY travel does.

54318,"&gt; In theory I agree, but the problems at Fukishima were known about years in advance so its a bad example.

No, it's actually a prime example: Billions were sunk into Fukushima and even more was about to be sunk into it. They were building two new reactors (#5 and #6) on the same site.

That's the problem with nuclear. Once you have committed so much money you won't just give up that investment, even if it is a stupid idea to keep running it.

&gt; As to the rest of your arguments against nuclear, you make some really good points!

Thank you.

&gt; I know how they work, the problem is the efficiency and scale to use heated salt to replace fossil fuels is a lot more impractical than I've heard anyone supporting that technology admit. You lose a lot of energy in trying to store the heat and it has limited life (I've read 5-6 hours of decent energy output). Add in to that the cost to run infrastructure to these plants which are quite remote, and factor in loss, and its practical, but barely so for the cost.

If you can support nuclear then supporting this should be a no brainer ;)

Even if you only get 5 - 6 hours out of it after sunset that still gives you ample time to make use of the electricity. You could for example keep the output running at full tilt, then use the electricity to generate hydrogen. When the morning rush starts you could burn the hydrogen in a standard (natural gas) power plant and keep your base load.

There are ways around all these limitations if there is a will. The problem simply is that the amount invested in these technologies is remarkably small compared to what nuclear for example has received and is receiving with very little to show for really.

&gt; I'll have to do some more research. I think the Chinese have successfully built or tested a thorium reactor based on the CANPAR reactor design which has been shown to be incredibly safe, so i'm not 100% convinced yet that Nuclear isn't a possibly bridge solution. However the red tape and lack of construction expertise does limit the timeframe, which could negate the usefulness of it vs alternative energies IF the developments needed can happen in the next decade or two.

Both the Japanese and the Chinese are giving Thorium a whirl. The Chinese are also building a few CANDU reactors. All of them are supposed to be ""safe"".

Here's the problem though: The way safety is determined is by calculating the odds of something specific happening. The ""calculation"" is really not much more than wetting the finger, sticking it in the air to determine where the wind blows from and then attaching a number to it. So risk assessments are pretty useless (What was the calculation? There should only be one serious incident with nuclear reactors every million years or so? Fukushima alone had three reactors go critical within free days, that tells you how much these calculations are worth).

Furthermore, operating manuals etc. Are all based on the assumption of what is / can / should happen. If you step outside the operating manual (it has essentially a decision tree the operators are supposed to follow) all it tells you is: Kiss your ass good bye.

Many nuclear apologists, for example, when it comes to Fukushima retain that it wasn't the failure didn't lie with the nuclear reactor, but rather that the tsunami is to blame for it. This is a very dishonest statement because it is **our** technology that failed. It does not matter what caused the failure it only matters that we did have one. This is the big problem with any of these ""risk assessments"", they operate on the ""it can't be what isn't supposed to be"" and if what isn't supposed to be happens we're fucked.

54445,"&gt; I say circumcision because that is the procedure people mean they use male genital mutilation.

Sure, and yet you use the term female circumcision when talking about any form of it, even the ones that are less harmful or equally harmful.

At least I'm honest, I call both of them circumcision.

&gt;When articles like this is posted and people think of FGM I doubt the procedure they're talking about is a pinprick on the clitoris like some people like to bring up. It's the removal of the clitoris, the labia, or sewing up of the vaginal opening.

No, they're not thinking about a symbolic pricking. But I repeat, **all of it is illegal**. But male circumcision isn't. See the problem?

&gt;Compare it to circumcision where there is research that it reduces HIV transmission, phimosis, etc. Seeing it as acceptable is justified in Western standards and allowed here because there is a belief of health benefits. If there was zero research and the only reason they have was that they want men to be pure and not enjoy sex, I doubt it could be justified here.

Except the research is all post-hoc bullshit done to justify circumcision, not the other way around.

Phimosis is a non-issue, as infants cannot even retract the foreskin anyway. Phimosis cannot be diagnosed in an infant, and it's not a major problem anyway. 

For HIV, you only get the ""benefit"" of having a *slightly* lower risk of transmission **when having unprotected sex with an HIV-positive person**. 

Again, this is clearly not a good enough reason to justify circumcision. All of it is post-hoc done by Americans to justify it, which is why [almost every medical association](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/zsd8c/one_of_you_has_repeatedly_posted_a_fantastic/c67h34g/) other than American ones condemn circumcision.

E.g.

&gt;[Royal Dutch Medical Association (KNMG) (2010)](https://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/knmg-non-therapeutic-circumcision-of-male-minors-27-05-2010.pdf)
The KNMG states “there is no convincing evidence that circumcision is useful or necessary in terms of prevention or hygiene.” It regards the non-therapeutic circumcision of male minors as a violation of physical integrity, and argues that boys should be able to make their own decisions about circumcision.

&gt;And your entire quotation is essentially complications of botched circumcisions.

No, it isn't. What it was talking about is what's happening to boys and men in Africa. 

Do you think that boys and men in African villages are being circumcised by a doctor in a sterile hospital? No.

So, if you really are serious about immigrating, you need to do something to increase your score. As has been mentioned here already, Quebec runs its own system and gives priority to french-speaking applicants (i.e. given two applicants who differ only in that one speaks french and the other does not, the french-speaking applicant will score higher.) They give this priority on the basis of proven language skills, not country of origin (though it's easier to show fluency if you've been educated in a former french colony, such as Senegal, for instance,) and I personally know of applicants from non-french-speaking countries who were successful because, among other things, they took language courses prior to applying. I know enough Italian to know that, as a native speaker, you should be able to meet this qualification by taking some courses and then passing the relevant french exam. That's a start. Second, if you could get a degree (doesn't matter so much what the field is, what matters is that it is a university degree, not a diploma or certificate program,) then you could apply to a post-secondary program in Canada. Most graduate programs provide funding and tuition grants; it's not a lot, but it is enough to live on (barely), and as graduate student, you would be able to work while you were enrolled.

*  It is better for several parties to have to govern together than for one party to make all the decisions in government, even if it takes longer for government to get things done.

You can source yourself to see how many lawsuits have been publicized in the press by employees who have been harmed by the actions or inaction of their employers related to PTSD.

One RCMP officer just filed last week for constructive dismissal for suffering PTSD.

Every employer in Canada has two duties:

1). The duty to assist - requires that employers assist injured employees to the point of undue hardship.

2). The duty to refer - requires that employers refer injured employees to medical professionals when it's clear they are unable to perform their duties.

Countless cases show an endemic problem with first line responders not being assisted while injured on the job.  A simple online search should turn up many.

Let's be clear what WCB does when a claim for PTSD is received.  They require the claimant to undergo an IME - independent medical exam, except it's anything but independent.  Rather a paid hack that is hand picked by WCB will ""test"" and interview the claimant and then deny the claim for frivolous and obscure reasons.

I know one individual injured on the job, suffering from PTSD (diagnosed by both Health Canada &amp; an independent psychiatrist) who had to sue the government for compensation and permanent disability.  As this individual was a federal public servant, they ended up spending $185,000 in legal fees and their compensation is hindered by no fewer than 13 pieces of federal legislation.

It's probably unlikely that they'd purchase Dutch Genetics (eg. Sensi Seeds, or Dutch Passion, etc.) and then take a strain from there and re-name it.  If they grew out seeds of say, ...Great White Shark, or Dutch Treat it's unlikely that they'd just re-name it to something ""proprietary"".  Instead they'd likely take the seeds, grow them out en masse, and select the choicest plants with the characteristics they really wanted, and cross them with another strain to create a whole new cross and then either simply grow it out continuously from cuttings/clones; or attempt to continue to work with the cross and create a stable hybrid line of their own.

So starting with Dutch Genetics (second to none in terms of stability and quality); creating their own crosses/hybrid strains, naming them ""Telus Timewarp"" or some other idiotic name.  Then selling those lines to consumers.

That'd be my guess.

I'd assume the LPs have their shit together enough NOT to do what so much of the black and grey markets do, which is taking a decent landrace strain, cross, or hybrid and naming it something 'catchy' or appealing and selling it off.

Sure, the registry may not be great, but scrapping it is not the solution. Weapon registrations are the norm in majority of the first world:

57670,"&gt; How much can someone have on themselves at any time?

This is a matter covered in [Bill C-45](http://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/42-1/bill/C-45/first-reading) as it falls under the criminal code for possession of a substance. Of course this won't be the final version of the bill, but it's what we have to work with right now. To reference the relevant part:

&gt; **8** **(1)** Unless authorized under this Act, it is prohibited

&gt; **(a)** for an individual who is 18 years of age or older to possess, in a public place, cannabis of one or more classes of cannabis the total amount of which, as determined in accordance with Schedule 3, is equivalent to more than 30 g of dried cannabis;

So as the bill is now you'll be able to possess up to 30g of dried cannabis in public if you're 18 or older.

&gt; What should the legal limit be before it's considered over?

This will also be covered by the federal legislation as it would be pertaining to the criminal code. The legal limit for Colorado, for example, is 5 nanograms per ml of blood which is likely along the lines of what we can expect the limit to be in Canada as well. We'll have to wait and see what they decide to set it as.

&gt; How do we do roadside tests? What are the protocols? Are there more than one tests?

An approved screening device (ASD) is what officers use to determine the level of alcohol impairment in one's body (breathalyzer). The ASD to identify the presence of drugs in one's body has yet to be chosen, but when it is the ASD will be able to screen for the following drugs: cannabis, cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamines. The ASD will likely be included in part of Bill C-46 as all ASDs *must* be legislated for officers to use. The police powers will be granted through Bill C-46 which contains the amendments which will allow for officers to go straight for the ASD sample regardless of reasonable probable grounds. This includes going straight to breathalyzer or drug ASD for both alcohol or drug-impaired driving. 

Provincial sanctions may also be expanded upon when it comes time for the provinces to decide how they wish to manage the cannabis legislation. This could take the form of increased penalties and fines for operating under the influence of a drug or 24-hour licence suspensions. Provincial sanctions are already in place for all provinces and territories which give officers the ability to give you a 24-hour licence suspension if they have reason to believe that you are unable to operate your motor vehicle for *any* reason, this does not necessarily have to be alcohol or drug related. We'll have to wait and see what the provinces and territories decide to do.

Criminal stuff will be handled by the federal government where as the framework for distribution etc. will be handled by the provincial government.

What everyone is kind of forgetting is that one country can not really interfere in the criminal proceeding of another. There have been Canadians on death row in the US that we haven't 'saved'. Khadr was not a POW. He was classified as an enemy combatant and that designation isn't even protected by the Geneva convention - which is why the US used that designation (not the first time they skirted the Geneva convention BTW).
Canada really didn't have much legal footing in how the Americans treated their enemy combatants and let's not forget, although the terms of his repatriation incl. him completing his entire sentence, he was released in 2015, 3 years early.

I think he did a good job of describing what he characterized as 'gravy'. By tying it into councilor overspending he established his definition of 'gravy' as areas of obvious waste with absolutely no public benefit. The only other specific example of 'gravy' I can remember him giving during the campaign was when he spoke about contracts that didn't receive enough competitive bidding.

Essentially, he made the point that he would be able to bring the budget in without cutting any legitimate services and insinuated that there was so much waste (gravy) that its elimination would facilitate his budgetary goals. Anybody with sense, even talk radio guys like John Tory who largely supported Ford, admitted that his numbers didn't add up. They knew it was nonsense to suggest that there was so much waste present that it could offset the deficit. I'm sure Rob Ford also knew it was nonsense, but it would be a lot harder to attain victory of he ran on platforms like eliminating water fluoridation and letting all parks fall into disrepair and disuse after cutting their budget. 

That's the point they are trying to make. The 'gravy' was a fairy tale. There was never enough 'gravy' to effect the budget in any meaningful way. Actual cuts would be necessary (if raising taxes was off the table).

If this is the only offence you've ever committed (as an adult), you are inadmissible for a period of 10 years from the date you completed all of your sentencing requirements. If, for example, you were ordered to pay a fine, complete a class, and/or undergo probation, the timer doesn't start until you completed all of those requirements. After 10 years, you are no longer inadmissible and undergo the same process as those without criminal convictions.

However, after just 5 years, you can apply directly for criminal rehabilitation ($200), which if successful, would result in the same outcome as above. It takes 8 months currently for applications to be processed in the USA.

TRPs can be processed at the port of entry or consulate. You don't have 8 months to wait, so only the POE route would work. You should be aware that officers at a POE will often come to differing decisions based on the same set of evidence. Moreover, you do not have a strong case. A TRP is supposed to be issued when there is strong evidence for economic, scientific, or academic benefit to Canada and/or a humanitarian and compassionate rationale. With that said, it is the officer's choice and some may go out of their way to help you. By regulation, they are instructed to be more conservative and not issue a TRP absent a strong case. 

If you are refused entry, be aware you will be immediately removed from the country, if there are no flights for the rest of the day you may be held in a cell, and your airline will charge you for the cost of the flight back.

&gt;At the age of 15, the Toronto-born son of Ahmed Khadr, a ""senior associate"" of Al-Qaeda, was **alleged** to have thrown a grenade that killed one American soldier and wounded another in the early stages of the Afghanistan conflict... 

It has never been proven Khadr threw that grenade. They found him unconscious and took him into custody. 

Even if he did throw the grenade, what would you do if you were under attack by an army? You'd fight back. It was a war. That's what happens in wars, people get killed. It's not a 'crime'. 

&gt;...After being captured and detained he was sent to to Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan and subsequently Guantanamo Bay where he endured years of torture and abuse. Officially, he pleaded guilty and confessed (he now argues his confession was under duress) to ""murder in violation of the laws of war""...

There is no such crime. The US government can write whatever ridiculous laws they want, they can intentionally avoid declaring war to try and get around their own laws, they can invent new categories of combatants, and nobody else has to pay any mind to that in their own national courts because it's complete bullshit. 

&gt;... she left a great deal of the nuance of the case out for viewers, omitting most of the facts about Khadr's ordeal—not once mentioning he was a child or that he claims his confession was made under duress....

&gt;...The first half of her sentence is an exaggeration. The fact is, some sort of compensation seemed inevitable. Throughout the course of his imprisonment, it was revealed Khadr was mistreated to the knowledge of the Canadian government. In 2008, The Toronto Star revealed that while the government was maintaining he was being treated ""humanely"" Khadr was being mistreated by the United States government in Guantanamo. In 2010, the Supreme Court ruled that Khadr's human rights were in fact being violated at Guantanamo. The decision wasn't made in a vacuum when it was acknowledged the Canadian government was aware their citizen was abused by another government as a child and adult and did nothing to stop it...

&gt;Rempel: ""The prime minister has said this was done for some sort of financial reason to save money, but the reality is that this was a decision made by his government and not by a court of law.""

&gt;Fact-check: The first half of this sentence is accurate. From Trudeau, himself.

&gt;""If we had continued to fight this, not only would we have inevitably lost, but estimates ranged from $30 to $40 million that it would have ended up costing the government,"" he said. ""So this was the responsible path to take.""...

Yes, Trudeau paid it to put an end to it and prevent having to pay more in the future, on legal fees, and probably a bigger settlement. What is wrong with that? Nothing. It would have been stupid to drag it out further. What happened to him was a Charter violation. The government was not going to win, even if it was a Conservative government. She is making it sound like Trudeau wanted to pay Khadr, for fun. 

&gt;But back to Rempel.

&gt;...This decision is not the first of its kind. In 2007 Canadian citizen Maher Arar was awarded $11.5 million along with a formal apology by (Conservative PM) Stephen Harper's government after spending 10 months being tortured in a Syrian prison. Of course, because Rempel did not mention what Khadr endured at all, the point of why Khadr was awarded a $10 million never really came up.

&gt;As for it being a government decision, yes it was. But it wasn't made in a court-less vacuum. The courts had made multiple rulings and the Liberals had lawyers giving them advice...

This is one of the examples where she was technically telling the truth. 

&gt;Rempel: ""What was disappointing for me as a legislature and for my colleagues was that this decision happened after our House of Commons, which is similar to your Congress, rose for the summer. So right now we're not sitting. We usually have an opportunity to ask questions like 'why did this happen?'""

&gt;Fact-check: True. While it didn't happen in a vacuum as Rempel suggested initially, it's true that representatives aren't currently sitting and there's no question period to demand answers from the Liberals.

And, it's meaningless. Her only true statements are like this. Yes, Parliament is not sitting right now. That has no relevance. 

More dissembling and dancing around:

&gt;...Fact-check: Bringing up the families of the soldier, Christopher Speer who was allegedly killed by Khadr, and Layne Morris, who was blinded by a grenade, Rempel suggested that Khadr being awarded his settlement ""probably pre-empted and prevented Tabitha Speer [Christopher Speer's widow] from obtaining those assets"" suggesting because Khadr was awarded he somehow took away from any settlement she might receive from the Canadian government. In reality, Speer's widow attempted to freeze Khadr's payout because she's currently trying to sue him in Utah for $134.1 million. Tabitha Speer accused Khadr of hiding assets in her attempt to freeze his payout, which the judge promptly denied.

&gt;Rempel: ""Canada values the relationship we have based on our men and women in uniform serving shoulder to shoulder with each other and I think there are a lot of people going, 'How did this happen and why?' Again, I think our prime minister has to answer.""

&gt;(When asked by Carlson why the prime minister didn't call Speer's widow) ""I'm sure that's something the prime minister should answer for, I know [former] prime minister [Stephen] Harper has reached out to her."" 

&gt;Fact-check: Again, Rempel is framing this as though the issue at hand has to do with what Omar Khadr served time in prison for. The settlement has nothing to do with what he may have done when he was 15 or how Canada honours their relationship with the United States. He's not getting money as a reward for his crimes that he served time for. The settlement and apology are only about the crimes committed against him as a prisoner with the Canadian government's consent.

&gt;The one thing this interview largely missed was context. Before the interview aired, Carlson began introduced the segment by saying ""crime does pay,"" adding Khadr would be the richest man in your neighbourhood. Going on to explain how he ""made his money"" Carlson told a heavily skewed version of Khadr's story in which he joined the Taliban, and was sent to Gitmo for killing a man. He then went on to tell his audience, ""Lucky for Khadr, he was born a Canadian citizen so after being released he sued the government of Canada for his imprisonment."" Again, drilling into the point that Khadr's settlement had more to do being rewarded for his crimes than torture, Carlson said Trudeau gave Khadr an official apology for ""being mean"" to him.

&gt;Rempel was slightly more generous in the words she used, but she too largely ignored all context. Rempel not only conveniently omitted that Khadr was a 15-year-old kid at the time of his arrest, that his rights as a Canadian were violated under the government's eye, and that he claims he confessed under duress—she repackaged facts for an American audience. While none of this is surprising considering how often Tucker Carlson has been caught spreading falsehoods on air, seeing a Canadian MP fuel right wing American panic is more than a little bit concerning in this current environment.

Everything she said in that interview was exaggerated, taken out of context, lies, misleading, and intended to rile up conservatives on both sides of the border by leaving facts out and appealing to emotions. The few things she said that were true were irrelevant, like the fact that Parliament is in recess. It was a highly irresponsible thing for her to do. 

The journalist is being professional in empirically dissecting Rempel's misleading statements and Tucker Carlson's duplicity. I get that you don't like the results, but that's no reason to accuse the journalist of having poor writing skills and injecting her opinion into it. You're basically saying she's writing fake news - a typical response from Conservatives when presented with facts. You turn it around and say the facts are fake, and the lies are the real news.

The natives of South America have built far more bigger cities and civilizations than those who remained in northern North America (Canada) There is no denying to this fact.

Of course the reason why the natives of South America built more extensive nations than those who remained in North America, is mainly because of the climate.

Canada and the US have mostly continental and polar climates. South America however (and parts of Mexico) are of course mostly tropical. Which means much more plants and animals, so you have a lot more food, which means you can sustain a lot more people, which means you can build much bigger and powerful nations.

So there you have it. North American natives didn't have the wildlife resources or climate to support building a culture with cities and empires in mind.

Yes, it is: ""In Islam, right from the beginning, fulfillment of the basic needs of everyone who is unable to meet his/her needs was conceived to be the concern of the State. Zakat is the first institution of social security in Islam. Payment of 2.5 percent of his/her savings for the zakat fund is one of the fundamental duties of a Muslim. The State is responsible to collect zakat and make arrangements for its distribution. Non-payment of it is equivalent to waging war against the State. The Caliph Abu Bakr subjugated by force all those who refused to pay it.""

*In this case arguing something that isn't quantifiable is a pointless waste of time. It may or may not still have come about without f funding from the churches. You say it woulndnt have, I think its absurd to think it wouldn't have.*

I am not saying it wouldn't have, but without that funding we would be far behind where we are today. If you are going to try to argue otherwise, I suggest you imagine a world without any universities whatsoever, because that is the world you are suggesting. How much scientific advancement would we have today without them? The same can be said about the height of the scientific revolution. It is no small coincidence that the timing of the rise of the western world began with the creation of numerous, church funded universities. Before that, the knowledge base these universities were founded on was thanks to the work of monks in monasteries toiling away and copying manuscripts their entire lives to preserve knowledge, or through the translations acquired from the ---&gt;MUSLIM&lt;--- world. Please try to tell me how the scientific advancements we have today could have occured at the time they did without religion.

*That whole paragraph is just nonesense ramblings. Wtf are you even trying to say here?*

Reading comprehension, how does it work?

*Religion is created by by humans so it has human flaws, it is not impossible for us to move away from our nature into developing new ideas without being hindered by old disproven ideas. Religion is what holds on to that dearly and it is the fault of religion that so many humans maintain this trait.*

This is the paragraph that doesn't make any sense, as I was attempting to point out. How can religion be both bad because of human flaws, and cause the human flaws that make it be bad? If you are arguing religion is a manifest of human flaws I might agree with you, but to argue that those flaws would disappear without religion is pretty naive.

*No, I'm trying to explain my point in a way that makes it easier for you to understand. I would have thought it would be clear to anyone that when I was talking about a revolution in scientific disvovery in which Islamic run countries and theocracies were left behind I was referring to a specific timeline. What you're doing right now is deflecting. You're focusing ona minute detail that is seemingly unimportant in the bigger point and ignoring that regardless of what time period I was referencing it doesn't change that what I said was true.*

I am not sure that was clear at all. The worlds you said were scientific revolution. That is refering to a specific event. That's like me saying the American revolution occured in the 1800s, and then saying, oh, obviously I meant the revolution of the South against the North. When you use the proper name of something, you are referring to that something. That you are now arguing you were referring to something different is trying to cover either your lack of knowledge of history, or your poor communication skills. At any rate, I'll accept it was the later, rather than the former. 

As to your second point, no, it is not true. Actually, the Muslim world wasn't left behind because of anything to do with religion. It was a hell of a lot more complex than that, and I could really write a lot on that. At the same time, Europe becoming much more advanced had nothing to do with it somehow escaping religion. I suggest you read Newton's book sometime and see how many times he references god. Europe was still a very christian place at the time of the scientific revolution and industrial revolution. Indeed, trying to blame religion for either the rise of Europe or the fall of the Muslim world really gives it far too much credit, sort of like the people who claim Rome fell because of those damned Christians.

64242,"&gt; You seem to think there has to be this balance between the rich and the poor

Well, there does. But you've taken that concept to the extreme, as is common with ideologues. To say that there needs to be balance is not to say that everyone should have equal income.

An economy where the wealth all slides to a few *will* collapse. It is unstable and unsustainable. There does need to be a division that shares generated wealth across the population. Not equally per person. Economies work well within a range of relative wealth. Too little difference removes motivation for generating wealth. Too much difference leaves too little available to the masses to keep the economy running.

My definition of ""fair"" is based on the link I gave for the Ultimatum Game. Wealth is, by definition, excess output of labour over that which a person consumes for their own needs. By definition, it is the workers that create the wealth. They are the Player 2s (Deciders) in the Ultimatum Game. The business leaders generate the opportunities for wealth, not the wealth itself. They are the Player 1s, the Offerers. It is a symbiotic relationship if done well.

It is the structure of transactions that affect who gets what share. If structured such that the Offerers can take most of the wealth created by the Deciders, that is the very definition of a parasite. A parasite creates a power structure to take resources generated by somebody else.

Unions, regulations, or other forms of government driven benefits that force a more symbiotic split creates a more prosperous society than the parasitic one. And, as a voter, your personal interest is in a system designed to benefit *you*, not a select few of others.

Yes, unions can be greedy and bully. So can business owners. Using deadbeats as an argument against unions is a strawman and equivalent to me using sweatshops as an argument against business owners. As in the link, the whole point of fairness is to make sure that there is equal power, not one side of the relationship who can bully and exploit the other. That's my definition of fair.

64598,"That would depend on the court and their relations with their subjects. It's not true that pagans had no rights under Sharia in general. Medieval Islamic law organised society around castes with Islam at the top, followed by the Abrahamic religions which were afforded special considerations, to pagans and atheists at the bottom. The way the caste system was configured allowed for upward mobility towards increasingly priviliged beliefs, but disallowed what was perceived as regression. Their rights were more limited and as a whole they had to submit to Islamic rule, but nonetheless they had rights, they were subjects with some legal standing. There are historical precedents for pagans even achieving protected status as dhimmis as well. The Chaldaean pagans, which practiced some weird quasi-Indo Hellenstic Babylonian astrology, are one example. Obviously there was a preference for pagans to convert to Islam, something which was often not true for the standard protected religions. Very similar to contemporary Christian thinking of the time, paganism was seen as a deviation from religious truth. The very first Dhimmi contract, the Constitution of Medina, included pagans as to having rights. Later developments were not charitable.

As for idolatry, every major monotheistic religious institution looked to it as a form of heresy, a subversive reversal backwards to paganism that corrupts the purity of the religion. Thus they were heavily persecuted within Islam, as was the custom of the time. What's quite interesting is that because of the mobility mechanism, religious uniformity was policed also in the protected minorities to ensure that they would not slide backwards into pagan elements themselves. Minorities which already practiced idolatry were allowed to continue to do so in accordance with their customs, unless they were targetted for conversion.",canada

Honestly, I don't know what kind of research you've been doing, but I'm pretty sure it hasn't been academic or particularly thorough. 

The residential school system was essentially developed as a sort of program of cultural genocide. The first schools were opened in the late nineteenth century, and the last one closed in 1996. The 60s scoop was a next step implemented by the government in the 1960s, where children were taken away from their families and ""fostered"" with white families. Hundreds of thousands of children were removed from their families and communities, often by force, or at least, the families didn't have any choice but to participate.

Here's a short blurb on some of the greater injustices of The Indian Act, which is the body of legislation that the government has been using to govern the indigenous populations of Canada up to and including present day.  https://www.ictinc.ca/blog/21-things-you-may-not-have-known-about-the-indian-act-

""And I'm going to ignore that little racist outburst because you seem to mistake the Catholic Church (among others) for ""white people"" 

First off, I am white, and I'm as WASPy as they come. I've also had the benefit of a pretty thorough education in Canadian history, and I do realize that not everybody has had that privilege. 

But here's the thing. Put your own ego aside for a minute, and think about this. If your parents and grandparents, and aunts and uncles had been stolen by the Canadian government - and for most, that's what it amounted to, the theft of children - and raised in a massively abusive system where thousands of little kids DIED, would you say ""oh, that was the church and the government, not all white people""? 

If your family lost your language because your parents were beaten every time they spoke it, would you say ""oh, that was the church and the government, not all white people""? 

If you were aware that the British government had PROMISED IN WRITING that you would retain your lands and your freedom, and then you were locked onto reserves and LEGALLY not allowed to leave them, and all that land that they promised they would not steal from you would you say ""yeah, that government is terrible, but, not all white people""? 

If you knew that your parents weren't legally able to VOTE when they was younger because they were status Indians, would you say that? Indigenous people weren't given the right to vote until 1960. 

These are all things that are part of the living memories of indigenous people, right now, today, in Canada. It's not two hundred years ago, it's not one hundred years ago. This stuff was happening in LIVING people's lifetimes.

Incidentally, we'd probably save a lot of money if we just dealt with mental health and other health problems sensibly.  I mean, how many people right now are less productive than they could be simply because they can't afford medication or therapy that they need?  So they feel sick and can't work as much or work at all?  Think of all those sick days.  All those people not working.  All that government assistance.  Actually, it's even worse than that because many people with mental illness who don't get treatment end up in prison because they fall short of NCR-MD and it costs a fortune to imprison someone in this country.  Now, imagine we had just paid for that medication.  Or given them therapy.

So, I think it is very likely that we'd break even or better if we just improved our healthcare system.  Not right away of course, it would be expensive at first because it would take an initial investment of money and take time to bring about the desired effect.  But, if we really tried hard, did all the right things, and were willing to spend that money, I think we could do it.  

However, I think you're right.  People are short-sighted and they don't want to spend money on others who they perceive are undeserving.  They think it is wasteful and they just want a tax cut for themselves, even if that is objectively worse in the long-term for literally everyone.  When they understand the issue or when it is someone they know, it is different, of course, but most people aren't like that.  Most people don't understand mental illness and most people don't *think* they know someone who is or has been mentally ill.  Probably we need to focus on educating people first.  Because frankly, with attitudes as they are today, I would never reveal if I had a mental illness.  Frankly, I wouldn't tell people about *any* condition constituting a disability if I could conceal the information, considering the prejudices people have.

Feminists say Feminists are for equality, yet now there is a push to get more female graduates through universities when female grads outnumber male ones, there is already more assistance for women, and there are official policies to discriminate against men.  Do feminists say a word about this because it's not equal?  No, instead, the focus is on how there is inequality because men outnumber women in one specific field at universities, STEM.  This inequality actually serves to achieve the lack of equity women receive in greater society, it's actually a good thing women are unequally represented and still receive preferential treatment, as it will result in faster equity elsewhere.

I think the best example of feminist equality in action is how 43% of domestic abuse victims are males.  Males are, by all means, able to physically defend themselves against women most of the time.  However, because we live in a society of equity, we apply social pressure to men to prevent them from using their strength, to attack, or defend.  Then, at the same time, we don't fund domestic abuse shelters for men and self proclaimed feminists harass people that open them to death.  However, this is a victory for feminism, because men being disallowed from protecting themselves by escaping a bad situation or using physical force, makes them have more equity to women.  When we're all suffering, we're all on level ground after all.

Now I don't know if you know, but Canada is the second largest country in the world, nearly 40 times larger than the UK. We also have about half the population of that country.

Now most people don't consider this but every competing cellphone company does need to set up infrastructure to be able to provide coverage to the consumers. Given that the country is so large and the population density is scarce when compared to a country like the UK, its easy to see that there would be a significantly larger maintenance cost for the big 3 to be able to operate.

The UK has a population density of 255 people/KM^2. 

Canada has a poulation density of 3 people /KM^2.

So if I were to build a radio tower that covers 50km in either country, I'd have a little over 10,000 potential customers in the UK and less than 200 potential customers in Canada per tower.

Only because Khadr came back to Canada. Imagine trying to enforce a similar ruling on actions that happened outside of Canada. I like our Supreme Court. I generally agree with them. However, they have made several rulings in the last few years which are troublesome given that they imply jurisdiction outside of Canada. 

This ruling by the SCOC also creates a problem in that now, 1. if Canada knows a person is being mistreated outside of Canada, and 2. the gov't knows it will be held complicit if they talk to that person; the solution seems to be not to have any contact.
