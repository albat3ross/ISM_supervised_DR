4277,"At first they were both center right, PO was slightly more liberal on social issues and economy in theory, but in practice PIS was slightly more liberal on economy thanks to Zyta Gilowska (one of the very few good PIS politicians, sadly she died already). 

In the elections PIS and PO first won together against postcommunists SLD collapsing because of corruption scandal. And everybody expected them (PIS and PO) to form a coallition, because their programs were almost the same, they both came from Solidarity and AWS party that was a continuation.

But they drifted away, partly because PIS had slightly more votes, and decided to make a coallition (very controversial at the time) with far right LPR and left populist Samoobrona instead of PO, to avoid sharing power with similar big party.

This only lasted 2 years and ended with premature elections because of many crisises in the government (abusing power to wiretap opposition and journalists, corruption and sex scandals in Samoobrona, and PIS believing polls that gave them more votes if they do elections). They did and PO won :)

Then came 8 years of losing all elections, and Smoleńsk crash, and Jarek was the more populist and cynic brother of the two. So they turned into this populist far-right and socialist mix. If you compare quotes of PIS from 2006 and now it's the complete opposite. They praised rule of law and how good our institutions are, denied any ""conspiracy"" during Round Table talks with communists in 1989.

4430,"&gt;OK, here is the issue: FGM can't be justified by Islam.

Yes it can, in some interpretations as I've shown numerous times now in previous replies. 

&gt;but only moral viewpoint of some scholars.

Indeed, I agree a viewpoint whom some scholars justify via the hadiths as can be seen in the links you don't seem to have visited...

&gt;https://islamqa.info/en/60314

.

&gt;That's not Islam. 

 Perhaps not true Islam - whatever that is. I've already made clear numerous times now, that Islam varies in it's interpretations and that rival sects and interpretations often self proclaim themselves as ""true Islam"".

&gt;OK, again, Islam is about Koran and for some hadith. If there is no such a source in those, there is no connection to Islam. Islam isn't something you have additional sources, or holy persons like Christianity, and Islam doesn't have a church. 

&gt;Problem is, **they're not cherrypicking.**

You cant cheery pick you say... but...

&gt;**only thing you can cherrypick** from is Koran, which is forbidden but why not, and hadith maybe. Rest are interpritations, and it's not the religion. You can't cherrypick religious aspects, if things you're picking aren't religious aspects but rather interpretations, on in this case some moral advises.

You seem confused and obtuse. I've already stated numerous times now, that I have not claimed FGM is a religious belief present in the Qur'an and that Islam varies in it's interpretations and sects, all differing on certain matters like FGM. And that not all Muslims are religious and/or follow every demand of their religion/interpretation of - this is what I meant by ""cherry picking"", you could call it ""ignoring aspects of their religion/interpretation of""; for example fajr prayer - not all Muslims seem to practice that. 

&gt;Some scholar saying something isn't different than some fool of the village saying something. Both aren't related to Islam, if there are no relations to Koran or hadith. 

I think I've already shown FGM has links to certain interpretations of Islam, with the justifications arising from primarily the hadiths...

&gt;https://islamqa.info/en/60314

&gt;Therefore, no justifications by Islam. 

FFS, Yes there are justifications in some interpretations of Islam...

&gt;https://islamqa.info/en/60314

.

&gt;Unless if you can show me a verse or some hadith about it, while hadiths are also meh, but still.

I've directed you numerous times to you Islamic literature you seem to have overlooked where they utilise the hadiths as there justifications for FGM.

&gt;https://islamqa.info/en/60314

.

&gt;while hadiths are also meh, but still.

It doesn't matter what you think about the hadiths, particularly for someone who says he isn't a Muslim. What matters are those Muslims who use hadiths to create rulings on matters in the life of a Muslim, particularly those Muslims who practice FGM. Unfortunately though Quranists who ditch hadiths could help form a more progressive interpretation of Islam prohibiting FGM, they're a minority in the Muslim world though. 


&gt;mate don't get me wrong, but you can't understand things with the way different paradigms from other religions, or just by reading 2 books or papers on a subject but don't know even how things do work. You clearly don't. You don't even know, what's Islam, what's inside the core or tied to religion, what scholars are, what branches are, etc. I mean I can see that you don't even know how religion or branches work, like you assume being Shafi or Shia or Hanefi is something like being Orthodox or Catholic. It's pretty impossible to argue with somebody who doesn't know the basics of the stuff he is talking about. Things you're claiming isn't less absurd than claiming, I don't know some art teacher claiming red is a cold colour, and saying colour theory has this inside its core? Anyway, if you're into claiming things about a religion that you don't have any idea about, I suggest you to learn how it works and how mentality of that belief is, without going with weird assumptions or take outs. 

Now you seem overly butthurt, making strange claims in regards to colour, a seeming fallacious allusion that I'm a European Christian or Jew (when in fact as can be seen from past posts of mine, I'm an apostate or Murtad) and further fallacious claims that I'm seemingly that ignorant of Islam's various sects/branches/interpretations, claims of Muslim scholars, hadiths and the Qur'an and the differing religiosity, culture, priorities and interpretations amongst Muslims etc, all despite my previous comments stressing numerous times of the various interpretations of Islam's various sects/branches/interpretations, claims of Muslim scholars, hadiths and the Qur'an and the differing religiosity, culture, priorities and interpretations amongst Muslims etc.

If anything, you've showed yourself I'm afraid to be overly pedantic, obtuse and confused.

These all benefit, in your case, Swedish companies and the benefits flow through to the Swedish economy and the Swedish people. It's much harder to measure because it's not the direct money that you're giving to them, but it does have a significant benefit. Most of the money that goes to Italy, for example, goes to the southern regions because they are as poor as those of the former eastern bloc, and the countries such as portugal, greece and spain have been poorer than those of Northern Europe for most of the last 50 years at least (longer even I'd guess) and the same applies to them as to the former soviet countries, except on a smaller scale. 

I haven't read much about this extra 30% over 7 years, so I can't comment unfortunately, but hopefully you can see from what I've written above that it will end up benefiting Sweden and other contributing countries, if not immediately than in the long run.

Yes, joining the euro now is a stupid idea. But these benefits flow through to the entire European economy where there is free movement of goods, capital and people. I imagine at some stage Sweden will probably join the Eurozone which benefits to a greater degree than non-eurozone countries from these effects. You have to remember the Euro is very new and is the most sophisticated, advanced currency of its kind.

The Russians encircled and destroyed the best Ukrainian units in Ilovaisk and Debaltsevo, and then dragged the Ukrainians kicking and screaming to Minsk to sign the same peace agreement they've been demanding since before the fighting escalated in summer 2014. This is no stalemate, it's a decisive military victory.

Freedom of speech allows for that. While some people are dickish about it, criticism of faith is allowed over a free country and for good reason. It allows science to operate without interference, it allows questions to be asked, it allows for debate, it allows for freedom of religion. You don't get to tell other people what they hold sacred.

&gt; I'm sick of people who tell me we should remove religion from schools

People aren't trying to remove religion from schools. If you want to prey at school... you can. If you want to read the bible or Quran at school... you can. Religions education is important at school and will always remain in schools, though the focus over time has now been from ""Teaching people the religion their parents follow' to ""Understanding a variety of religions and the effects they've had, the beliefs they hold"" it's a more objective approach to teaching religion where things are explain well and are discussed. There are also plenty of Religious Schools in the world, catholic schools, jewish schools, muslim schools which have a heavier focus on the religious elements with the school playing an active role in the practice of the religion.

&gt; ""separate the Church and the state""

Again something very important. The state is supported by the tax payers. Let's take America for example because it doesn't have an ""Official religion"" and has many issues with separation of 'Church and State'. For a start church refers to any religions hand in politics, it just so happens that in the west christianity has had the biggest influence.

Here's America's rough religious breakdown:
* 70.6% Christian
* 5.9% Non-Christian Faith
* 22.8% Unaffiliated (Atheist, Agnostic, Non-Believers, Nothing but Religion not important, Nothing but Religion Important)
* 0.6% Don't Know

All of these groups pay taxes to the state. As a result it would be unfair for the state to then spend the tax money of the non-Christians (Who make up 29.4% of the countries population) on statues and such for religious purposes. To support one religion over the others. It also stops religions from effecting law and using law as a way to mess with other religions. Separation of church and state is the reason why churches don't pay taxes in America because of ""No Taxation without Representation"". By having separation of church from state laws come from a more balanced perspective rather than being based off of faith (Which you might see an issue with) but is an issue in a society that has such a diverse group of people. In America however a large amount of senates are religious and the times they have used tax money to fund religious projects naturally if caught, they've been punished for it because that's now how tax money is meant to be spent.

&gt; and ban religious symbols in public and the Church teaching because it's ""hateful""

If a church wants to build something on their land then thats okay, no one is stopping that. However what people get pissed about (Rightfully so) is the state building religious symbols with tax payers money, the rule is if they do it for one religion they need to be open to doing it for them all... and with the amount of religions there are, that would cost insane amounts and you'd have no space... and thus it's decided that the state cannot erect religious symbols. If you want to wear a cross round your neck, display one in your garden, have one at a church then no one will stop you. If people were to be able to stop that American's would have the train wreck that is the Ark Experience... ironically funded via huge tax breaks by a local down... which are likely to bankrupt the town because the Ark is making huge losses (And he's now cutting staff pay illegally).

&gt; choose their religion when they grow up

While I don't agree with the crowd who thinks parents should never teach their children a religion. I believe you should leave the door open for other beliefs. If your child grows up and decides that they don't agree with the beliefs they were brought up with... then there should be no issue with them changing religion or leaving religion behind all together. Challenging your beliefs is important for both believers and non-believers. Critical think skills are important and following something on blind faith isn't generally a good idea, be that religious beliefs or newspaper articles claiming things. The difference is between forcing and encouraging. If you're encouraging your kids to go to church on Sunday that's fine, it allows the door for them to go ""no I would rather not"" it gives them an option but also teaches values of respect. While I don't follow a religion if a girlfriend's parents do I while I would tell them that I don't subscribe to their beliefs, if they asked me to go to church with them I would out of respect for them. Forcing children to follow a religion however is indoctrination and can get abusive. The key difference is Force or Encourage. Encourage does use force and is done through understanding and discussion. Force is doing without thinking for the other persons actual wants. That goes for if a child does end up changing or loosing faith as they grow up, forcing them out because of that isn't fair. Everyone holds different beliefs even if they subscribe to the same religion and they display them in different ways, to deny someone a chance to choose their own religious path be that one of faith or one of scepticism goes against the idea of personal freedoms.

As a result of the 2007 crisis, the flow came to a halt and reversed course (a *sudden stop* occurred), and in 2010 the redenomination risk (i.e. the possibility of returning to national currencies) that emerged precipitated the European economic crisis. Since then, money granted to Greece has actually been used to repay debts it held *vis-à-vis* French and German banks.

In other words, European taxpayers' money rescued German and French banks that engaged in irresponsible lending (an irresponsible loan implies an irresponsible lender, and actually banks are much better equipped than businesses &amp; households to assess risk, both micro and macro).

As a side note, Italy, whose banks were not involved in the lending spree in Greece, had to give away at least €65 bln directly through the ESM which essentially was a bailout for German and French banks. This is very laughable.

In short, German and French banks were and are still being bailout out indirectly through the bailouts granted to Greece financed with European taxpayers' money. In normal conditions Greece would've defaulted, but Trichet (then ECB president) said ""no!"" and since then the damage of this eurocharade has only increased (actually, without the euro there would haven't been any bubble in the first place).

Had Greece defaulted then, the burden would've fallen on German and French banks, but now it is European taxpayers who would incur the losses after this ""swap"" managed by the Troika. That's why a default/restructuring/haircut is systematically ruled out even though it is necessary, as made clear by the IMF.

Spain experienced the same, but at a smaller scale and mainly in its real estate market. Actually, up until 2007 its finances were rock solid (like Ireland's) and it [did everything right](https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2016/07/15/2168347/if-spain-didnt-need-capital-controls-why-would-anyone/).

Now let's go through this thread real quick.  

The original comment I replied to said:

&gt;The USA is the largest producer of natural gas in the world and in the past ~10 years the industry has been gearing towards more international trade since the NG prices fell. It just looks very disingenuous when one of the main competitors proposes drastic sanctions on Russian gas (an industry the USA unlike Germany is not dependent at all).

Then I said:

&gt;It's not disingenuous at all, increasing LNG exports is specifically spelled out in the legislation.

I was explaining there that it cannot be disingenuous with regard to gas sales because the legislation specifically said that the purpose of the sanctions was not only to punish Russia, but to promote our gas.  It's right there, we aren't hiding anything, it's not an ulterior motive. 

So then another redditor said:

&gt;And now you know why your last sanctions on Russia is just to support your fracking industry and sell LNG.

and I replied:

&gt;No, that not the only reason, but it is a stated reason. We aren't trying to be duplicitous on this issue.

So the only issue under discussion is whether or not the US is being duplicitous, as everyone agrees that the US wants to increase LNG exports to Europe.  My position is that we are not duplicitous, because the plain language of the legislation states that it aims increase our LNG exports.  

So then you comment:

&gt;And you know that because you work in the White House? Stop acting like you are an american government official.

I mean that is completely out of left field, and why I thought there must be a reading comprehension problem.  No, I don't work in the White House, but I am capable of reading that the legislation explicitly states  that an aim of the sanctions, it's not a secret CIA plot. I haven't even stated an opinion on it, not sure why you were triggered.    

So really, I don't know what to tell you if you have read everything and understand it.

As far as your private message, I'm sorry, that's just creepy and cowardly, and no one has ever done that to me in 5+ years of redditing.  You have something to tell me, you can say it here in front of everyone.  You say I am a know it all?  I looked at your comments, you are not one to talk. The difference between you and me is that I am aware that a forum full of people arguing over policy is going to be full of ""know it alls"" and I can admit I am one of them. As for you, I don't think self awareness is your strong suit, and scolding people in private is really not cool, I'd take that one out of your repertoire.

The definition it supplies is ""Treat (someone) as a child or in a way which denies their maturity in age or experience"" - you distorted this by cutting it off. Moreover, all of the examples provided by the OED concern humans: ‘No one infantilizes adults more than the conservatives and the extreme right'.

The MW definition is far less clear and offers no examples. What is does do is connect the word to the the word 'infantile', which is obvious, but tells us nothing. 

Finally, if we google 'infantilize the debate' we get a total of 5 results. Of these 3 are comments by users and 2 are from the same article reproduced on two different websites. This is consistent with the incorrect usage of a term.

I'm all for the flexible usage of language. However, if we want to retain language as an effective tool of communication, there have to be limits. My argument here is in fact not that the author doesn't use a human object to the verb. 'Infantilise' is a very aggressive term. It implies a removal of control, not simply the distortion of one's arguments. A man might infantilise his wife if he talks down to her as if her opinions have the intellectual value of a child's. Similarly, we might infantilise a nation if we assert that they cannot survive without their colonial oppresors. But the Economist is not asserting that the Germans are immature and need a grown-up to take charge. They simply disagree with the German perspective on trade surpluses and, at worst, are a bit dismissive of the arguments that support that perspective.

The problem is that the nationalist/far-right parties often start with rallying people against Islam, but they actually are for conservative Christianity, actual racism, homophobia/misogyny or less democratic political systems. Case in point, FN in France wants to reverse gay marriage rule. A leader of AfD in Germany said ""you don't want Boateng (a Ghana-German footballer) as your neighbor"" and Boateng is *Christian*. Recently Polish right-wing governing party want to make jurisdiction no longer independent from other branches of government. Also, being against Islam does not equal oppressing Muslims for their beliefs. You can prosecute them for what they *do* that is illegal/harmful, but if you discriminate based on belief it's a slippery slope (thoughtcrime). History showed that oppression never ends with one minority.

Edit: one kind of people that I despise most is those who say ""free speech!"" for conservative Christians/nationalists advocating genocide or extreme discrimination, but want to jail any Muslim who preaches similar hate. At least be consistent.

[Homicide rates](http://imgur.com/SnlrJea) show a clear increasing trend going eastward in Europe. Homicides are essentially the single crime that are fit for international comparison, which aren't heavily influenced by mundane factors such as public trust (lower willingness to report crime) or the differences in funding (leading to far lower clearance rates). If you legitimately believe that Hungary, pop. 10 million, experienced ~300 sexual assaults last year (police numbers were around that much), while Sweden with the same population had ~18.000, then...But [incarceration rates](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6m0d50/number_of_prisoners_per_capita_in_europe/) are an indirect way to gauge criminality as well. 

Appalachia is a popular argument which entirely neglects the rural/urban division of crime. The same number of people spread around 10 counties will naturally be less criminal than the same number of people living in a single city neighborhood. West Virginia has a population density of 29 people/km^2 . Purchasing power is naturally different as well in bumfuck-nowhere, WV and a global city like Paris, so the deprivation is greater for the urban poor. 

And yet with all that, Paris yields a [homicide rate of 2.77](http://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2015/10/15/le-ministere-de-l-interieur-livre-enfin-les-chiffres-de-la-delinquance_4790212_4355770.html) (by far the highest in France), [peaceful redneck WV a 3.8](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/murder-rates-nationally-and-state).

Closing ports to NGO vessels is ever more likely the closer the election looms, as the migration issue is dominating this electoral campaign. Once closed, I doubt they will open again any time soon.

A less obvious effect will be felt over time by various measures the EU (and its member states) have agreed upon. These include but are not restricted to propping up the Libyan coast guard, enacting new rules of conduct for NGOs, maybe even establishing a border force on the Libyan-Niger border (which was discussed this May) or migrant camps in North African countries.

The EU can do plenty *if* the member states agree to do something. The last bit is of course where most attempts to do something fail. 

I still base my hope on the fact that national leaders understand another migration crisis spelling the EU's end. This might force them to agree to harsher measures or grant the EU a more powerful mandate. While the ECBG remains harmstrung by the member states, the basis for an effective border force exists. It ""merely"" requires a slightly stronger mandate and a mighty increase of its budget and permanent personnel.

1. There is a very vocal and active minority against soldiers.
2. While most soldiers understand that the majority in Germany gives a shit about the military. The effect is that the only feedback soldiers get is negative. Let it be in experiences in public or from the press. The press will not report on the military unless it is negative (which is understandable) but then also show a complete lack of understanding on military matters.

To make it clear: As a German soldier you can expect the following things:

1. Be insulted in public.
2. Have the press only talk about your profession when they have a complaint.
3. Have no support from politics.
4. Have no public support whatsoever.

&gt;During the Invasion of France, German aircraft violated Swiss airspace at least 197 times.[15] In several air incidents, the Swiss shot down 11 Luftwaffe planes between May 10, 1940 and June 17, 1940.[15]

-

&gt;On June 20, 1940, the Swiss air force was ordered to stop intercepting planes violating Swiss airspace. Swiss fighters began instead to force intruding aircraft to land at Swiss airfields. Anti-aircraft units still operated. Later, Hitler and Hermann Göring sent saboteurs to destroy Swiss airfields. However, the saboteurs were captured by Swiss troops before they could cause any damage.

-

&gt;From 1943 Switzerland stopped American and British aircraft, mainly bombers, overflying Switzerland during World War II: six times by Swiss air force fighters and nine by flak cannons, and 36 airmen were killed.

-

&gt;Switzerland, surrounded by Axis-controlled territory, also suffered from Allied bombings during the war; most notably from the accidental bombing of Schaffhausen by American planes on April 1, 1944. It was mistaken for Ludwigshafen am Rhein, a German town 284 kilometres away. 40 people were killed and over 50 buildings destroyed, among them a group of small factories producing anti-aircraft shells, ball-bearings, and Bf-109 parts for Germany.[20][23][24][25]

Which islands are you even talking about? Name them and let's see if they're more than 3nms away from the Turkish coast in which case article 16 applies.

In addition you claimed

&gt; These islands are within our frontier laid down by the treaty.

So i asked you to point to the exact article that hands over those islands to Turkey. If you just talk out of your ass just say it and don't waste my time.

&gt; From what i know, it did constitute a problem. The important thing here is that they broke the treaty.

No treaty is above the national security of Greece.

&gt; Too few of them compared to the Turkish side. And less important resources.

Doesn't matter. Treaties and human rights don't disappear under a certain density.

&gt; What i am saying is that Greece declares certain zones as their territorial waters and airspace and justifies it by saying it is near their island

All islands have their own territorial waters and airspace not just in Greece but anywhere in the world.

&gt; while disregarding the fact that those zones are either closer to the Turkish mainland, or at an equal distance.

That doesn't make any sense.

&gt; Also you conveniently forgot that those cleansings were started by Greece first, and we agreed because both sides wanted a homogenous population.

What are you talking about, ethnic cleansing is illegal. Greece never agreed to Turkey cleansing the Greeks of Constantinople, Imbros or Tenedos, their rights are secured in the treaty of Lausanne.

Not quite. I'd be interested if you can give a legal argument as to why Srebrenica doesn't classify as a genocide, but simply saying 'the numbers aren't big enough' doesn't qualify as a legal argument as the convention on genocide doesn't mention a numerical limit in order for something to qualify as a genocide. The key in the whole debate is that the Trial Chamber of the International Court of Justice ruled that genocide as a crime can be localized, and UN documents on criminal law say that 'every member of the group need not be killed in every corner of the globe' in order for a crime to be classified as genocide. What is important is the *mens rea*, or intent, to commit a genocidal crime, which was proven in the Srebrenica trial through evidence of conversations and plans made by Mladic and senior VRS officers around the time the enclave fell. Bosnian Serbs only had that group under their control and under their ability to kill, they didn't have the ability to kill every Bosniak and no one is claiming that genocide was committed in the whole of Bosnia but just in the local region of Srebrenica. To put it in a comparison, if someone said they wanted to exterminate the Croatian population from Zepce, and they drew up a carefully orchestrated plan to carry this out, that could certainly qualify as genocidal even though it would represent less than 1% of the Croat population. Plenty of crimes in Bosnia qualify for the *actus reus* of genocide however they do not have the proven intent required. For example, Goran Jelisic was tried for genocide, and they found he fulfilled the material aspect, though, despite the fact he killed hundreds solely based on their ethnicity, this was not part of a wider intent to exterminate the group in part or in whole and so falls simply under the crime of persecution.",europe

*It was almost like a game, a cat-and-mouse hunt. But of course we greatly outnumbered the Muslims, so in almost all cases, we were the hunters and they were the prey. We needed them to surrender, but how do you get someone to surrender in a war like this? You starve them to death. So very quickly we realised that it wasn't really weapons being smuggled into Srebrenica that we should worry about, but food. They were truly starving in there, so they would send people out to steal cattle or gather crops, and our job was to find and kill them... No prisoners. Well, yes, if we thought they had useful information, we might keep them alive until we got it out of them, but in the end, no prisoners... The local people became quite indignant, so sometimes we would keep someone alive to hand over to them [to kill] just to keep them happy.*[40]

When Australian journalist Tony Birtley visited the besieged Srebrenica in March 1993, he took footage of Bosniak civilians starving to death.[41]

The judgment of the Hague Tribunal in the case of Naser Oric found that:

*Bosnian Serb forces controlling the access roads were not allowing international humanitarian aid—most importantly, food and medicine—to reach Srebrenica. As a consequence, there was a constant and serious shortage of food causing starvation to peak in the winter of 1992/1993. Numerous people died or were in an extremely emaciated state due to malnutrition. Bosnian Muslim fighters and their families, however, were provided with food rations from existing storage facilities. The most disadvantaged group among the Bosnian Muslims was that of the refugees, who usually lived on the streets and without shelter, in freezing temperatures. Only in November and December 1992, did two UN convoys with humanitarian aid reach the enclave, and this despite Bosnian Serb obstruction.*[42]

EDIT:Hell, I don't even know what oath you're thinking of as being characteristic of Nazi Germany.  It might be the infamous [Hitler oath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitler_oath), which wasn't a citizenship oath *either*.

Hitler military oath:

&gt;I swear to God this sacred oath that to the Leader of the German Empire and people, Adolf Hitler, supreme commander of the armed forces, I shall render unconditional obedience and that as a brave soldier I shall at all times be prepared to give my life for this oath.

Hitler civil servant oath:

&gt; I swear: I will be faithful and obedient to the leader of the German Empire and people, Adolf Hitler, to observe the law, and to conscientiously fulfill my official duties, so help me God.

The whole reason that that particular oath was objectionable was because it was a *personal oath of loyalty* -- that is, Hitler was asking for loyalty to him personally, not to the state or constitution.

The loyalty in the US citizenship oath is very explicitly to the Constitution.

Since you get paid for the overtime it's a good way to increase your take-home pay, especially as a lot of the overtime work can be, let's say, less than amazingly productive. And older firms, especially, still see time at work as a sign of dedication; more hours will mean a faster career path.

But yes, it's ultimately bad both for the workers (for obvious reasons) but also for the economy at large. If people spend all their time working they're not spending money.

Likewise, saying Churchill caused the Bengal famine is just wrong, but a discussion about how he willingly allowed it to continue for longer than it needed to is  a possible discussion to be had where both sides can make valid points.

Most Brits I've spoken to aren't aware Churchill sent his own version of Gestapo (Black and Tans) to Ireland to murder and rape their way around the country ""to keep the rebels down"", who committed these atrocities knowing they were sanctioned to roam free and do as they like.

Frankly, most of the people there (french as well as dutch speaking) would loathe the idea, because the Flemish separatists like to claim the capital as their own although less than 20% of the people here speak dutch. I think the same sentiments are felt in Wallonia.

I don't think I really understand the mood in Flanders, so I can't speak to that part. But I don't think there is a lot of support for actual independence, more for larger separation of government. You could compare it to the US where some people want more power shifted to the states.

I've been afraid for some time now that the strategy for the Flemish separatists has been to stretch out the negotiations and pointing the finger at the frenchspeaking politicians for not giving in for so long that they can somehow get to independence that way. Bart De Wever, the leader of the separatists, actually said something like ""We are willing to negotiate, but not when that means we have to give in on anything"". 

There has yet to be any sort of real outcry from the people for anything. They're were one or two demonstrations, but they didn't have a solid message, more like ""let's just make a government, you guys"". It's all kind of depressing and a lot of youths won't care as long as it's not really affecting them. I've been hoping for a long time that a student movement would stand up and take real action, but nothing of consequence has been done by anyone.

While it is true that Polish people do not like when foreign governments and organisations meddle in our internal affairs I am not so sure if people would only blame the EU for sanctions. 

For most of people in Poland, EU is this enigmatic structure that they don't really know much about. I would argue, that if you asked an average Pole, they wouldn't know the difference between European Commission, parliament and council. So when the sanctions hit and the EU money stops flowing, will the people really point the fingers at some organization they know so little of? Or will they point them at the faces they see everyday on TV and whose decisions have a much bigger impact on their day-to-day affairs? When Polish farmers lose access to EU funds, will they fly to Brussels to show their discontent, or setup barricades in Warsaw? And when EU investment slows down and it results in an economic downturn, will people connect it to sanctions, or will they blame the government that has promised them prosperity?

I don't deny here that some people in Poland will hate the EU for that. But I wouldn't discount the effect it would have on the government. If PiS is unable to sell to the public,the idea that sanctions are not their fault they will get hit the most. And lately, they have trouble explaining anything to the public.

This is exactly what the problem is here, isn't it? I mean, I'm aware that the international narrative is pushed differently, but is there are real substantial reason for that? This system is a matter of constitutional legal basis for Poland, and regardless of which party is in power, it will still be in place in this form. So the question is, is the narrative justified on the basis of the devised appointment system or is it something else?

&gt;sn't that what is being done? The other EU countries are saying that what Poland is trying to do won't fly.

Doesn't matter what they say or think. If objectively their systems doesn't hold itself to a higher degree, then the commonly held standard is a somewhat minimum level, a level which Poland would be legally satisfying. Article 7 requires there to be an infringement of those values. 

If Poland wishes to appeal against the invocation of Article 7, it goes to the CJEU. Then the CJEU needs to make an assessment of how the appointment happens in each state, and how that differs in this case for Poland. If the CJEU finds that there is no substantial and material difference between all the systems, and that it works essentially more or less the same, then Poland is deemed to have satisfied the basic requirements of democratic system and rule of law that is part of the EU acquis.

Well no shit. He is affected  by the nationalism in Russia and Russian nationalism.

Ukraine can't influence Russia with their nationalism.

&gt;sanctions are not due to nationalism

But they are. It is part of Russian Nationalism that the Ukraine doesn't exist, that Crimea is Russia, that Ukrainians are Russians (you guys are like us on smaller scale, serbia vs western serbia)... Hence you could make a case that nationalism helped imposed sanctions on Russia

Sanctions where oligarchs lose a lot of money to be quite honest.

&gt;Sanctions are due to Russia's stupid decisions for almost everything.

But they're not stupid decisions. If they accepted their guilt they'd have to admit to supplying and providing soldiers and equipment in Eastern Ukraine. Which is worse than having sanctions, since technically it's an act of war.

While technically right now, Russia and Ukraine are not at war.

32591,"&gt;There is no such thing as a safe anything. In both examples, a state decides to enforce medical procedures upon those who may disagree.

It's about risk management because the risk of getting a deadly disease, if not vaccinated is far greater then having a bad reaction to a vaccine, so no comparison there. 

Secondly, a state is responsible for all its citizens. Therefore a government have to minimize the risks for all people and is entitled to deny you access to for example schools as long as you pose a risk.  
&gt;And I guess you do not believe in things like right to bodily autonomy (or human rights per se).

As I said: You as a person have the right to opt out, if you don't want but it has consequences. 

&gt;Hahahaha, yeah, right. ""Don't bother, I am sure I will win"". That works everytime.

Well, if you leave out the part where i explain why, I can't help you. 
Anyway to be sure I'll explain it again:
The risk of getting a deadly disease or one which leaves permanent damage is far greater than having a bad reaction to a vaccine (btw. usually doctors stop vaccinating as soon as they figure out that there are some complications). 
Live is about risk management and reasonable people try to minimize risks because you can't live without so they wear a seatbelt while driving or look left and right before crossing the street. 
This is something they teach their children too.

&gt;So somehow, magically, my kid has less human rights than I do? That's a fucked up world you want to live in.

Here is the magic trick: When your kid is old enough he / she can opt out, but up until this point you are acting in his / her best interest. Being healthy is in his / her best interest. 
Herd immunity and for that matter a low count on child deaths is a public interest, so it is just natural to require basic vaccinations because public interest correlates with the interest of the child.  
And don't pretend a vaccination is like amputating an arm or a leg. 

&gt;They are not zero, therefore from an ethical standpoint, they may not be mandatory.

Well as I said: As soon as the doctor notices complications, he will stop the vaccination (and at this point your kid relies on herd immunity). 

Edit: An example to further clarify may point: You are, in most western countries, a free person and therefore free to decide whether to leave a place or not. Now let's imagine you are on an airplane and you decide to leave during flight. They are not going to let you. They probably going to anesthetize you too because you pose a risk to all people on board. ",europe

32762,"&gt; The US isn't a model to follow.

Europe follows that model already. Because the US also allows everyone who sets foot on US soil to request asylum. And they will then follow their obligation from that age old refugee convention (that was created with the Holocaust in mind, to prevent that countries can reject people who ask for protection) to check if the applicant needs protection. And if that's the case they will issue asylum, in the US that happened 26,124 times in 2015. 

If the US would geographically be were Europe is they would face the same problems. It's their geographic position that keeps the asylum seekers out, nothing more. Because to reach the US from Nigeria you basically have to travel with a commercial airline. And they don't let you aboard if you don't have a US visa. And if they let you aboard, the airline is obligated to return you if your asylum request is rejected. 

Europe doesn't have that luxury. Asylum seekers don't enter via plane. 


And no, Trump did not abolish the asylum system. As far as I know he didn't even touch it, because that would mean to abolish the UN refugee convention. This is about asylum, the right of someone to request protection when they are on your soil. That's not the same thing as being a refugee who requests protection from outside your country. Europe deals a 100% with asylum cases. Unlike the US we don't have a permanent scheme that allows people to request protection from outside of the country. We resettled a couple ten thousand people from UNHCR camps, but these efforts were limited in scope and time.

Yes, almost all terrorist attacks have a high death count, but would handguns have helped in Madrid's attacks in 2004, the most deadly attack in Europe ever? No. In London's in 2005? No. But you can find several examples of ETA terrorists beeing shooted at by spanish police corps and/or french police corps.
No one prizes the criminal's life over the policeman's, people just prize live more. If we had to choose, obviously the policeman's live would come first but if you don't have to choose, why choosing?

Lastly, shooting in that situation would have been dangeorus. There were five policeman surrounding him, so if you shoot and miss you are risking one of your mates lifes, even if they weren't surrounding him, there's a crowd behind him, so any lost bullet could harm someone with a high probability.

The Super Etendard has been retired from service.

Which was btw also one of the reasons why Germany didn't behave as horribly here as they did in Poland - they were worried that being too brutal could cause large-scale rebellions and that would disrupt the production.

There is a wide gap between public expectation of what the EU *should* do and what it actually does (or indeed, is allowed to do).

The migration crisis has been simmering for years, yet the EU is not a metre closer to a true and effective ""European"" solution. That's what breeds scepticism among the masses of ordinary voters: ""if the EU is unable to act on this, what is it good for? All they do is talk and talk.""

The elites know how difficult things really are, but the rest of the voters do not. And if the elites keep failing to make the EU seem to work for the masses as well as the elites, its reputation will plummet. If the EU acted resolutely and effectively in the migration crisis (e.g. by setting up robust common EU border guards, establishing safe zones in Libya and Syria, creating off-shore asylum processing facilities to discourage further illegal attempts to reach European shores with fake asylum claims, etc.), its approval ratings would be 50% better there days.",europe

I'm not a nihilist. I'm a realist. The only solution for Ukraine is getting Russia to agree to fuck off. Gifting weapons to Ukraine, won't change shit. Russia is completely ok with the situation right now. A ton of new weapons will simply kill a few more people. Aks Putin how much he cares about that. If there's one thing Russia has, besides gas and oil, it's a bigger shitload of old weapons.

So what will we have in the end? The US will gift you some weapons. By that they'll make sure to get a foot into the market. They'll start making money, thanks to the fucked up situation in the Donbass region. Ok, not they, the military-industrial complex. Nothing will change after that. A few, ok a lot more, people will get shot. A lot of ammunition will be spent, but wait, now you're firing that other shit. Not the old AK ammo. Now you started using the NATO ammo. Someone will have to sell you new ammo, after you started using the new shit. Let's guess, who that will be.

And then, hmm, wait if one batallion is starting to use the new weapons, then why stop there. You can't have different systems, that would be stupid. No army is using the Russian and the NATO system at the same time. You would need to buy ammunition for both systems. Nah, that's bullshit, let's simply switch...I guess, you will need a few more weapons, in order to have a uniform system in the army. So now someone needs to sell you a few more rifles. 

And if you're already using the rifles, why stop there? What about your outdated RPGs...we all know, that the US anti-armor weapons are way more effective, you want to buy a few? We have a good deal for you and if you want we could get you a few used F-16, too. Poland has them and some other EE countries. And if you actually plan on becoming a NATO member, it would be best if you would buy them as soon as possible.

So now 10-15 years have passed, you have new American rifles, new anti-tank weapons and some new (used) nice airplanes. But the Donbass will still be, in the best case scenario some kind of Transnistria like republic, where nobody shoots anybody, in the worst case a fuckin war-zone.

They're sitting in your army and are ready to get bribed.

All these people coming here could go home and live in a place where they are the majority, I can't. This is it for me. And even the second and third generation guys here will refer to me and people like me as 'vous les français...'

Look, I was complaining quite some time back that I think that the EU's immigration policy is fundamentally flawed.  Right now, the EU lets any member extend citizenship, provides no member with any influence over the criteria that other members use, and requires all members to extend quite extensive privileges to the citizens of other members.  That's a risky combination; it's open to selling citizenship and the like.  Malta could, in theory, pull in a population the size of Germany and radically change the makeup of the EU.

If there's an issue with the EU on immigration, that's a big chunk of where it is.  It's not because positions on immigration have drastically changed, but because freedom of movement without some degree of shared control over immigration invariably is going to leave people in a position where immigration that the majority oppose can happen.

Maybe the EU needs immigration (unpopular or not).  Personally, I think that it does, if it's not going to get its birthrate up.

There has been a white variant of this lamp as well for about 30 years now, but it is less efficient and more expensive. While they are not exactly uncommon -you see them a lot on industrial complexes- they aren't generally used to light public streets.

Most of the white/blue lights you see today are probably relatively new and LED-based. Even more efficient and cheaper than the orange sodium lamps. I would think it probable that _new_ streetlights in the UK will soon be of the same variety.

I liked the old orange look, but the LED lights allow you to see better, for some reason reduce nightly crime rates, and are _relatively_ less light polluting. Most people forget the _relatively_ part... LED lights are better directional (less light going into the surrounding area and sky), but they are also significantly brighter (and thus more light goes into the surrounding area and sky due to more reflection). Additionally, light from the sodium lamps is very frequency specific and fairly easily filtered out of the night sky (unlike the broad-spectrum LED lights used). Seeing as Eindhoven is pretty much dead smack in the middle of one of the worst light-polluted areas in the _entire world_, that was helpful for us stargazers. But alas, it is no more.

I was just reading an article on here about the proposal of EU-level social security.  My guess is that ultimately, the EU is going to wind up federalizing or at the minimum having a common welfare budget, because if it doesn't, poorer EU members are just gonna have their welfare systems collapse due to people moving within the EU -- people are gonna move to the ""blue banana"", and eliminating more barriers to migration, like language, are gonna tend to keep propelling that process along.

They (this is common) are blaming a specific set of people though, not 'the people' at large.  Besides initially AKP only got 33% but an overwhelming majority in the parliament.

&gt; The nationalistic Kemalist 'social democracy' of the CHP and the Turkish establishment was a very authoritarian and overbearing regime for many pious Turks.

CHP wasn't even in the parliament in 2002 -- they were below the threshold.    The so-called po-mo coup of '97 did hurt a lot of pious people but I doubt it was enough to sway elections.  The reasons to support AKP in the first term would be things like completing the privatizations (the big one, the national telco hadn't been privatized yet), continuing with the EU harmonization packages, fiscal discipline etc.  We had an unpopular program implemented after the economic crisis of 2001 and AKP was uniquely positioned to implement it because it would pacify the people who'd have screamed otherwise and they had to do it because that was the only avenue open to them (the establishment would have taken them down otherwise, as they tried in various ways).   This was the calculation: they'd finish destroying the power of entrenched interests with the economic transformation plans; subdue the pious masses who could, if in opposition, be mobilized against the new policies; continue on the set path to securing Turkish candidacy for accession to EU while pulling their loud anti-West base to positions compatible with it etc.  The flaw in the intellectuals' support was not about supporting AKP, the flaw was telling people that they were either 'liberals' or were 'liberalizing' out of their own ideological bent.  That latter bit discredited both those intellectuals and more or less finished off the label 'liberal.'  

&gt;  In this case, if Kemalism didn't have so many shortcomings, the program of the AKP - which initially seemed very progressive, like overhauling the healthcare system and making it modern and universal - would not have appealed to large swaths of the Turkish population.

I don't even know what Kemalism is or was as of 2002.  The social security reform did happen alongside many others, yes.  I used to joke that, with some modifications, what they did would have had some other party pegged as 'red' _by their own base_ just a decade or so ago.

Why can't Italy deny landing to boats carrying illegal immigrants just like the French and the Spanish did and do?

&gt;They leave because they think that if they make to Italy and somehow don't get caught

Are concepts so difficult that different words carrying the same meaning confuse you? ""And somehow don't get caught"" = negligent and permissive behaviour that encourages illegal crossing.

&gt;This is an hipothesys that seems to make sense

Yes, that's been my point for the whole conversation.

You don't have the counterfactual case because Italy didn't deny landings.

&gt;What do you do?

I don't think it is the admiral who decides on foreign policy. If I were the minister of foreign affairs I'd probably tell the admiral to follow what Australians do under such circumstances. As I said, though, the best solution would be preventing boats carrying illegal immigrants from setting sail for Italy. In addition to this, the long-term solution would entail stabilising MENA, but that's probably beyond Italy's capabilities given that it isn't NATO's leader, even though it could do whatever it can to steer decision making within the alliance. Furthermore, relief programmes in Sub-Sahara should be reinforced and expanded.

This violation can only make sense if the right to criticize the government is independent of whether the state has made allowance for such rights or not. In other words, it can only make sense if the right was universal, applicable to all human beings, regardless of whether the right was respected by the government or not.

&gt;According to a sociological study published in 1981, the Swedish-speaking Finns meet the four major criteria for a separate ethnic group: self-identification of ethnicity, language, social structure, and ancestry.[Note 24] However, not all Swedish-speaking Finns are willing to self-identify as representatives of a distinct ethnicity. The major political organisation representing the Swedish-speakers in Finland, the Swedish People's Party, has defined the Swedish-speaking Finns as a people who express Finnish identity in the Swedish language. The issue is debated: an opposite view is still that the Swedish-speaking Finns are a sub-group of the ethnic Swedes, östsvenskar or ""East Swedes"".

I am just as Swedish as any Swede from Sweden [rikssvensk, or ""Swedish Swede""]. Swedish is my native language and part of my identity and culture. We Finland-Swedes are not Finns, but Swedes.

And I finally understood what you mean by ""trust"". We in the real world call it ""influence"". US has influence over Israel, Saudis, Europe and as such US doesn't care about what they do. 

On the other hand, US will use all the weapons in its arsenal against countries who they don't have influence over and who happen to have interests which do not align with US interests. They will use actual weapons against countries who will not be able to retaliate militarily, it will use economic weapons against countries who will not be able to retaliate economically... So it's not about ""right and wrong"", it's about influence. I think we are pretty much in agreement on this one. 

And hence, as I said initially, Russia should just ignore US and continue to pursue its interests, the only other option is to blindly follow US.  The good thing for Russia though, is that its goal of the multipolar world is closer and closer, US' influence is decreasing, they will soon reach parity with China.

- Polls says that pro-independence voters will have a higher turnout that pro-union votes.

- Multiple pro-union voters says they won't vote in a referendum not sanctioned by the state.

- Abstention will be more than high enough to sway any potential result.

With those facts, it is not possible to infer the real support based on the referendum results. Do not confuse a referendum result with reality, they are not the same. Context needs to be taken into place, and in this situation, context is tricky. Let me try to explain this, and I will put what I think it may be actually a real result:

- One day before the referendum, a poll is done to measure the support. Result is 45% yes, 45 no, 10 don't know/won't answer.

- Referendum is done, result is 70% yes and 30% no with a 64% turnout.

- One day after the referendum, a poll is done again. Results are once again 45% yes, 45% no, 10 don't know/won't answer

According to you, the referendum represents the real support. Are those two polls wrong? By a 25%? Are the polls right and hundreds of thousands of people changed their mind the day of the referendum and changed it back the next day? If you assume the referendum result is fixed and represent reality, you can't properly explain what is going on.

But in reality, when you check the numbers, 45% of 5 million votes (random number) is 2.25 million. 70% of the 64% of 5 million is 2.24 million, barely any change. So what is the real support? 70%? 45%? That is a 25% difference. It is way easier to explain the numbers taking into account voters that in the polls say they are against but in the referendum they abstain. Specially when you have that same people announcing in advance they won't vote because they don't consider the referendum legitimate. Occam's Razor.

So the point of discussion shifts. Is it reasonable to consider that some voters don't see the referendum as legitimate? You may not agree, but most of the world will. Today, Spain is considered the sovereign entity that applies to Catalonia, and it has formally stated it does not consider the referendum valid. So the final question is:

- Is the international community willing to accept that a referendum carried over without the approval of the current sovereign entity is legitimate enough so abstentions have to be accepted as people renouncing to their right to vote instead of people rejecting the validity of the vote itself?

Accepting that principle opens a shit-storm. Who has the ultimate authority to make those referendums.

Let's consider recent referendums. I will ignore South Sudan, as Khartum agreed to the vote (there was more than 95% turnout and more than 95% support though). So we have Kosovo. Kosovo is a similar situation, it was not a vote held by the sovereign country, and actually, some of the population (Serbs) rejected to vote. However, when checking the results, you don't have the same uncertainty than in your case:

&gt; Over 99% of voters voted in favour of independence, with a turnout of 87%. The referendum was boycotted by Serbs living in the region, who comprised around 10% of the population

Even if every single Serb that boycotted the referendum vote against, even if you include any abstention as a no vote, the *for* won by a landslide. And even today, Kosovo is not fully recognise by the international community.

47858,"&gt; Faure [President of France] died suddenly from apoplexy in the Élysée Palace on 16 February 1899, while engaged in sexual activities in his office with 30-year-old Marguerite Steinheil. It has been widely reported that Felix Faure had his fatal seizure while Steinheil was fellating him, but the exact nature of their sexual intercourse is unknown and such reports may have stemmed from various *jeux de mots* (puns) made up afterward by his political opponents. One such pun was to nickname Mme Steinheil ""*la pompe funèbre*"" (wordplay in French: ""*pompes funèbres*"" means ""death care business"" and ""*pompe funèbre*"" could be translated, literally, as ""funeral pump""). George Clemenceau's epitaph of Faure, in the same trend, was ""*Il voulait être César, il ne fut que Pompée*"" (another wordplay in French; could mean both ""he wished to be Caesar, but ended up as Pompey"", or ""he wished to be Caesar and ended up being blown"": the verb ""*pomper*"" in French is also slang for performing oral sex on a man); Clemenceau, who was also editor of the newspaper *L'Aurore*, wrote that ""upon entering the void, he [Faure] must have felt at home"".

Maybe that's news for you, but socialists do praise capitalism as some new era. Global poverty is being reduced through the world history, that's nothing particular to capitalism but it's about tech and science.

&gt; Of course, socialist-inspired rulers are always incompetent when socialism implementation attempt inevitably fails. Up until failure it is real socialism.

Nobody sees North Korea as socialist, including North Korea itself...

&gt; Stalin was comparable or worse than Hitler (and yet commemorating the former isn't a crime).

It's a crime in some countries, like commemorating Hitler isn't in some. That being said, I can count you numerous genocidal maniacs or war criminals, who are regarded as heroes even starting with Churchill or American generals who genocided natives.

&gt; No, there is not nor was a single State that is ""really socialist"" (right?). 

China is capitalist, and that's not even an argument. If you're thinking that it's socialism, I can't see even a point to argue here.

&gt; After China ditched socialism as economic model and adopted capitalism in the 80s it dramatically improved.

In the expense of its own people. It's true though, and now China shows what a real successful capitalism needs, a Stalinist dictatorship.

&gt; So far it never happened. In practice socialism implementation attempts invariably lead to tyranny, serfdom, misery, suffering, death.

Again, that was also true for secularism and democracy. Every revolutionary movement is fated to see going backwards and counter-revolution winning, old system or even worse restored until it succeeds. Otherwise, we should have let go of democracy and secularism as well.

Euroscepticism (also known as EU-scepticism, from the Greek word scepsis meaning doubt) means criticism of the European Union (EU). Some observers, however, prefer to understand opposition to and total rejection of the EU (anti-EU-ism) as 'Euroscepticism'.

Traditionally, the main source of Euroscepticism has been the notion that integration weakens the nation state, and a desire to slow, halt or reverse integration within the EU. Other views often held by Eurosceptics include perceptions of a democratic deficit in the European Union or a belief that the EU is too bureaucratic. **Euroscepticism should not be confused with anti-Europeanism**, which refers to the rejection of the culture of Europe and Europeanisation, and sentiments, opinions and discrimination against European ethnic groups.

**Foreign policy of PiS**

On foreign policy, PiS is Atlanticist and less supportive of European integration than Civic Platform. The party is soft eurosceptic, and opposes a federal Europe. In its campaigns, it emphasises that the European Union should 'benefit Poland and not the other way around'. It is a member of the anti-federalist Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists, having previously been a part of the Alliance for Europe of the Nations and, before that, the European People's Party.",europe

They took the narrative of the post-communist order in Poland, combined it with the great tragedy of Smolensk, which is deeply personal to many of them (Jaroslaw Kaczynski lost his twin brother then-president Lech, his wife, and many friends, in that crash) and built a cult around that. It serves them as a classic Polish martyrology beacon and a political whip that they continuously use to bring their electorate together.

In Estonia we have some female conscripts, but we didn't have any in my battalion simply because we didn't have room for them - women would require their own barracks, showers etc... building those would mean a significant extra cost for the military. Money we don't have or sure as hell could spend more wisely.

Your anecdotal evidence aside, you can't deny the fact vast, overwhelming majority of men are a lot stronger than women. We had a doors open day where we showed some of our equipment and most girls that tried couldn't even lift a Carl Gustav launcher properly (the older M2 model). Now imagine them, in full gear, having to actually operate a CG or an MG for an extended
period of time. Not going to happen.

The military is a very demanding and a high-stress environment. Adding women to it would only make matters worse. Especially today, when every joke, slight or a bit of criticism aimed at a woman or her competence could result in a full-blown sexism scandal. The military has enough on it's plate as it is, it doesn't need headaches like that.

And finally, women themselves don't want to be in the military. What do you think would happen if we told girls they have to take a year off from clubbing and uni life and trade it for a year full of sweat and mud? They'd just leave the country *en masse*. Estonia is bleeding young women like crazy as it is, we can't afford to lose even more.

So like I've said, if there are women who are eager to join, all doors are open to them. However pressing large numbers of girls into military by force would only result in having weaker soldiers at a higher cost, headaches and social problems. Not to mention, not every citizen must be a reservist. You can build up more than a decent reserve from men alone.

The EU uses a veto-based system for many things (which I do not like, and think that the EU would be better off with all majority or supermajority votes but I realize that it's more-acceptable to members who might be dubious about joining the EU).  Because of that, if one is to ""override"" a ""rogue"" member, one has to totally strip the ability to vote from them as a fix for abuse of the veto.  (Note that I don't think that a permanent override is a good idea either -- I think that it should happen on a per-issue basis, but...)  So then you not surprisingly have two-or-more country blocs set up to protect each other.

Sure, it could theoretically work if everyone simply agreed to just work together, but, then, so could communism.

Honestly, I think that it's myopic to go after Poland and/or Hungary for this when the real flaw seems to be a design issue in the EU.  I would expect other EU members to ultimately do the same thing down the road.  That is, the fix for this is to eliminate the veto, not to whack Poland and Hungary for using the system in its present form.",europe

51293,"This is a fairly new thing in the last 5 years or so.  Basically, ""most PIN pads are for tippable service, so all PIN pads will just be this one type.""  US is very consumer driven, so I'm sure we have impacted Canada's systems now that we actually support chip transactions.

Tipping is weird here, a hold-over from the Great Depression.  Basically, I'm paying for the service.  If an employee makes less in tips than minimum wage, the restaurant will have to pay them the difference, and then they'll get fired.

We have a few places that say tipping is not expected, and they pay a low but fair wage to their workers.  Those places, the workers never hang around, asking for tips either.  (Sonic - drive-up hamburgers;  Starbucks - premium coffee).  To tip at those places, you have to have cash, and have to have it readily accessible.  Card/electronic payments give no option to tip.

Some places expect a tip.  20% is the standard.  If service was exceptional, then more than 20% might be warranted.  10% is ""you were horrible, and your manager should know it, but I don't want to make a fuss, and don't want you to spit in my food when I come back next month.""  0% is ""I'm never coming back, and if I do, I fully expect poop in my food.""  

This varies for low-priced and high-priced restaurants too.  If I pay $25 for a burger and fries, and my drink runs dry, then they have not earned 20%.  But if I pay $10 for a meal, and my drink is refilled three times, and I sit at the table for two hours talking to friends, then I might tip $10 or $12.

Also, I have a personal tip-o-meter.  Every trip to the table to do something I need is worth a dollar.  Every item delivered correctly is worth a dollar.  Mistakes don't count.  Delivery to my house is worth at least $5.  Whichever is greater, the tipometer, or 20%, is used to do tipping.  Uncorrected mistakes are a serious issue, and switch into subtracting from the base 20%.

Also, I have a favorite Chinese restaurant.  I order, and she'll drop the food at my table.  She cleans up when we leave.  I get my own drink, etc.  I spend $5 to $10, and I always tip $2 to $5.  It's the best Chinese food within 20 minutes of my house, and while I don't know her well, I feel she's undervalued and worth the extra.

On the other hand, some restaurants automatically add 18%.  See, 18% is less than 20%, so it doesn't seem like it's too much.  Except, if you received poor service, you have to talk to the manager to get the tip removed.  We have guilt, and confrontation issues, so we just let it slide.

On the other hand, I have friends who tip based on being a TIP at places which use tipping to cover the service charge.  This is offensive to workers, who may be working hard, serving lunch food at a discount, and getting very little pay for the extra hard work.

I really do think we're long overdue for removing the option to pay less than minimum wage in the US.  (We also have unpaid internships that also do not offer housing/food.  Lots of things designed to funnel money upwards.)",europe

On top of that Ariane 5 can lift 2 (or in some cases 3) satellites to orbit, while Falcon 9 often flies half empty, which makes the cost comparison even more complex, because Ariane customer pays for 1/2 (or 1/3) of the rocket, while SpaceX customer pays for the whole thing!

It has nothing to do with the war in Ukraine etc but more with the attitude of the people towards politics and their own country. In my country, it is basically the national sport to shit on our government and be against it. The biggest print newspaper is mostly anti-government. The biggest online news portal is radically anti-government. Even our subreddit is constant shitting on our government. Ministers and even governments are brought down by media discovering them doing shady things and publishing it everywhere. And that's how it should be, skepticism of those who rule you is healthy, they should be under heavy scrutiny. And I'm pretty sure my country is not the exception, this is widespread in Europe.

At the same time, most Russians will rabidly defend Russia and Putin and just make them look worse through obviously brainwashed behavior, ""everyone HATES Russia"", complaining about ""western propaganda"" while being willing to accept media that is literally state-controlled... Also they seem to have very little interest in purely internal issues and mostly care about geopolitics which is pathetic - the more advanced a society is, the more it becomes concerned with ""polishing"" its internal problems (corruption, liberty, political process, fairness, taxes, equality, justice system, prisons, sustainability, environmentalism...) and less with stuff like expanding territory.

Why I dislike their government less? Listen to Putin discussing some issues some time, he usually makes a lot of sense, and when he criticizes some western country, he will never make a fool of himself.

I am arguing that the death penalty for voluntary participation in a genocidal army is fair punishment and would be regarded as such by Americans if what had happened in Northern Iraq had happened in Washington state. 
  
Western nations hanged many war criminals at Nuremberg and Western nations still have the death penalty for lesser crimes. More to the point Iraqi law does and it is unjust to say ""No no, this white girl should be allowed to go home and face a different justice system because she is from where I am from and that is not where the victims were from"".


EDIT : I wish to add that I regard capital punishment as unwise for most crimes (as it can never be appealed) except where the state has a genuine concern that the accused represent a threat to the rule of law itself. Iraq lost control of a large swath of its territory, many cities and millions of its citizens and has the right, in my view, to apply the death penalty to those that willingly joined the organisation responsible for the mass murder of its civilians and usurpation of its power to protect them. This is the only crime I think is rightly punishable by death and if we valued the lives of Yazidis, Kurds and Arabs as highly as Europeans we would not interfere with Iraq applying that penalty.

Back in the days Poland complained because Russia retaliated with import restrictions on Polish apples and cheese.

Countries in Eastern European continue to buy gas from Russia. But selfish Germany who values its economy more than punishing Russia is endangering the security of Eastern Europe. 

&gt; Ukraine in particular is not in good shape to bear that load. The EU is less-influential if pressure can be applied to individual countries.

Like every trade, gas trade is a two way street. If Russia applies too much pressure countries will buy somewhere else. 

&gt; Secondly, being a pipeline provider provides Ukraine with some modicum of influence in the EU — and it has precious few guarantees or cards to hand.

And these ""guarantees"" are basically the main reason for building pipelines that don't go through Ukraine. Because in that case guarantee means that Ukraine will be able to take our gas supply hostage. And if they don't want to pay Russia for its gas they can just take whatever they want.

I think we're looking at star trek levels of futurism there. We'll continue to have deep inequalities for a long time. The human race continues to expand at a breathtaking pace, problematically so in those environments which do not sustain the local populations. Economic inequality across the world naturally triggers large scale migration in to more prosperous environments and economies. 

I think before we get anywhere near a truly globalised world, there's a few prerequisites :-


* Technological advancements allowing us to ascend beyond inherent limitations in various environments of the world, providing economic equality across the populations. 
* Religions which triggers strife (war) by seeking to limit people's rights and progress (and which attempts to spread itself aggressively) takes a back seat within our societies.
* We let go of nationalism and embrace the change (as you've pointed out).
* Government(s) act in the best interests of more than their term of service and work towards the best interests of all.

I suspect before we get anywhere near economic equality in globalism (the trick which would remove people's fear factor), we're going to have some horrible events within our populations as growth overwhelms our ability to sustain and service it (50-100 years is my guess). Instead we'll continue see globalisation across only rich nations, and all the politics and unfairness that goes with that. ",europe

56595,"**Britain faces up to Brexit**

As long as the government stays in denial about Brexit’s drawbacks, the country is on course for disaster

Jul 22nd 2017

CRISIS? What crisis? So many have been triggered in Britain by the vote a year ago to leave the European Union that it is hard to keep track. Just last month Theresa May was reduced from unassailable iron lady to just-about-managing minority prime minister. Her cabinet is engaged in open warfare as rivals position themselves to replace her. The Labour Party, which has been taken over by a hard-left admirer of Hugo Chávez, is ahead in the polls. Meanwhile a neurotic pro-Brexit press shrieks that anyone who voices doubts about the country’s direction is an unpatriotic traitor. Britain is having a very public nervous breakdown.

The chaos at the heart of government hardly bodes well for the exit negotiations with the EU, which turned to detailed matters this week and need to conclude in autumn 2018. But the day-to-day disorder masks a bigger problem. Despite the frantic political activity in Westminster—the briefing, back-stabbing and plotting—the country has made remarkably little progress since the referendum in deciding what form Brexit should take. All versions, however “hard” or “soft”, have drawbacks (see article). Yet Britain’s leaders have scarcely acknowledged that exit will involve compromises, let alone how damaging they are likely to be. The longer they fail to face up to Brexit’s painful trade-offs, the more brutal will be the eventual reckoning with reality.

**Winging it**  
In the 13 months since the referendum, the awesome complexity of ending a 44-year political and economic union has become clear. Britain’s position on everything from mackerel stocks to nuclear waste is being worked out by a civil service whose headcount has fallen by nearly a quarter in the past decade and which has not negotiated a trade deal of its own in a generation. Responsibility for Brexit is shared—or, rather, fought over and sometimes dropped—by several different departments. Initially Britain’s decision not to publish a detailed negotiating position, as the EU had, was put down to its desire to avoid giving away its hand. It now seems that Britain triggered exit talks before working out where it stood. The head of its public-spending watchdog said recently that when he asked ministers for their plan he was given only “vague” assurances; he fears the whole thing could fall apart “at the first tap”.

As the scale of the task has become apparent, so has the difficulty of Britain’s position. Before the referendum Michael Gove, a leading Brexiteer in the cabinet, predicted that, “The day after we vote to leave, we hold all the cards.” It is not turning out like that. So far, where there has been disagreement Britain has given way. The talks will be sequenced along the lines suggested by the EU. Britain has conceded that it will pay an exit bill, contrary to its foreign secretary’s suggestion only a week ago that Eurocrats could “go whistle” for their money.

The hobbled Mrs May has appealed to other parties to come forward with ideas on how to make Brexit work. Labour, which can hardly believe that it is within sight of installing a radical socialist prime minister in 10 Downing Street, is unsurprisingly more interested in provoking an election. But cross-party gangs of Remainer MPs are planning to add amendments to legislation, forcing the government to try to maintain membership of Euratom, for instance, which governs the transit of radioactive material in Europe. Even within the government, the prime minister’s lack of grip means that cabinet ministers have started openly disagreeing about what shape Brexit should take. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has been sniped at because he supports a long transition period to make Brexit go smoothly—a sensible idea which is viewed with suspicion by some Brexiteers, who fear the transition stage could become permanent.

The reopening of the debate is welcome, since the hard exit proposed in Mrs May’s rejected manifesto would have been needlessly damaging. But there is a lack of realism on all sides about what Britain’s limited options involve. There are many ways to leave the EU, and none is free of problems. The more Britain aims to preserve its economic relationship with the continent, the more it will have to follow rules set by foreign politicians and enforced by foreign judges (including on the sensitive issue of freedom of movement). The more control it demands over its borders and laws, the harder it will find it to do business with its biggest market. It is not unpatriotic to be frank about these trade-offs. Indeed, it is more unpatriotic to kid voters into thinking that Brexit has no drawbacks at all.

The government has not published any estimates of the impact of the various types of Brexit since the referendum, but academic studies suggest that even the “softest” option—Norwegian-style membership of the European Economic Area—would cut trade by at least 20% over ten years, whereas the “hardest” exit, reverting to trade on the World Trade Organisation’s terms, would reduce trade by 40% and cut annual income per person by 2.6%. As the economy weakens, these concerns will weigh more heavily. Britain’s economy is growing more slowly than that of any other member of the EU. The election showed that its voters are sick of austerity. Our own polling finds that, when forced to choose, a majority now favours a soft Brexit, inside the single market (see article). 

**Back in play**  
A febrile mood in the country, and the power vacuum in Downing Street, mean that all options are back on the table. This is panicking people on both sides of the debate. Some hardline Brexiteers are agitating again for Britain to walk away from the negotiations with no deal, before voters have a change of heart. Some Remainers are stepping up calls for a second referendum, to give the country a route out of the deepening mess. As the negotiations blunder on and the deadline draws nearer, such talk will become only more fevered.

So it is all the more crucial that all sides face up to the real and painful trade-offs that Brexit entails. The longer Britain keeps its head in the sand, the more likely it is to end up with no deal, and no preparations for the consequences. That would bring a crisis of a new order of magnitude.

&gt;“The point is that, if you were being logical, a common currency would be the last thing you introduced (after common fiscal policy, legal systems, market regulation, etc.) if you were trying to bring countries into some sort of political federation, since it would be a common currency and monetary policy that would expose all the tensions between economies.

&gt; Religion is a freely chosen collection of ideas. It deserves no greater protection than political ideology.

Religions deliver a metaphysical supernatural explanation of how the world works. Anybody who says that their religion dictates how society should work outside of a general set of ethics is a) lying or b) a fundemantalist. Religion and ideology are fundamentally different concepts.

In liberal democracies we don't punish or discriminate people based on philosophical explanations. We punish people for actions. We don't prejudge people based on what they believe in a sense that it holds legal ramifications. It isn't illegal to be a Nazi, it is illegal to try to establish a society based Nazi ideals.

You quite elegantly use a concept from the new atheist movement (the idea that any religious claim has to hold up to scientific study and if it doesn't it is dangerous) and combine it with the common idea that the state has a right to defend itself based on the commonly confused terminology of religion and ideology.

The problem here is that this way you create thought crimes. Being a conservative Muslim would be a thought crime, instead of trying to establish a society under Sharia Law through illegal action being an actual crime. Except it is even worse as you violate another fundamental tenent of law in democracies: to judge individuals not groups.

Of course if there is a high probability of somebody causing politically motivated crime than the state has a right to protect itself and the population from that, but at this point we're talking known people with a criminal history who still espouse their ideology.

Let me put it another way: Africa's already seen much larger-in agricultural collapses from when it redistributed colonial-era land.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_reform_in_Zimbabwe#Impact_on_production

&gt; Before 2000, land-owning farmers had large tracts of land and used economies of scale to raise capital, borrow money when necessary, and purchase modern mechanized farm equipment to increase productivity on their land. Because the primary beneficiaries of the land reform were members of the Government and their families, despite the fact that most had no experience in running a farm, the drop in total farm output has been tremendous and has even produced starvation and famine, according to aid agencies.[53] Export crops have suffered tremendously in this period. Whereas Zimbabwe was the world's sixth largest producer of tobacco in 2001,[54] in 2005 it produced less than a third the amount produced in 2000.[55] Zimbabwe was once so rich in agricultural produce that it was dubbed the ""bread basket"" of Southern Africa, while it is now struggling to feed its own population.[56] About 45 percent of the population is now considered malnourished. Crops for export such as tobacco, coffee and tea have suffered the most under the land reform. The main everyday food for Zimbabweans, maize, has been reduced by 31%, while small grains production has grown by 163%.[34]

* reserved heirs 
* forced heirs etc etc

I'm obviously in favour of equal rights, work ethics and so forth, but it's nigh impossible to take action against mass immigration, when our laws say we need to help these people, even when they mean harm. And it's incredibly hard to create stable investment in Africa, because our demands for transparency, minimum quality and so on, create a feeling of animosity among local governments who turn to China for a better investment, seeing as Chinese don't care about political demands, as long as the financial demands are met.

How much does real Parmesan from Parma, Reggio Emilia, Modena, Bologna, or parts of Mantua cost?  They have been making this cheese for over 800 years with the same methods.  If anyone was allowed to make Parmesan there would be no way to control quality, or to make sure that people aren't producing sub-par cheese with the name Parmesan.  Most regional delicacies are protected for this reason among others.  

Putting Parmesan into google I get a shop selling their cheapest for $23.27 per kg, and the most expensive selling for $49.11 per kg.

&gt; families come in all shapes and sizes

Yes they are... but not in the sense you're thinking. They teach kids/teenagers the types of things they will encounter in their lives. Like I've said before being gay is not a choice so it makes sense that in schools they teach that some people are gay and how that works in sex ed. Families are a personal thing and every has their own, everyone treats and handles it different. Teachers are not teaching that families come in all shapes and sizes. Teachers don't teach how a family should be at all, in fact most do not ever teach anything about adoption (Pass Adoption being an alternative to having a biological child), very rarely is foster care every brought up, neither is who and who cannot adopt children (Unless asked by a child themselves and if the teacher knows the current legal standing well enough to answer said question). Schools facilitate discussion so to a degree given the right class room, with the right children, asking the right questions a topic of families and what's considered okay could occur though at a state school that discussion would be lead by students and moderated by teachers. Just because you don't accept that families ""Don't come in all shapes and sizes"" doesn't mean they don't, in a world where Gay's can legally get married, in some cases also then also adopt it's important that if the question arises people can discuss the issues, positives and effects of such a world. Schools are for engaging people in critical thinking and developing those skills. They aren't teaching people this, they are giving children/teens a space in which they can make their own mind up on the situation.

&gt; rights as a parent

Rights as a parent always, always come second to the rights of a child. Examples of this are plenty. If your kid does something you doesn't like (Let's pretend they decide God isn't their thing) and you go at them with a baseball bat or fists. The rights of the child are their to protect them from the abuse. The child would be removed from your care and you would be prosecuted for your actions. Now I'm not saying you would, that's just an example. But when discussion education it's important to think about the needs of a child, something that will change from person to person admittedly. When assessing the education needs of a child you must look at the world they are entering so the school can address things that will be common place in their lives, along side skills to develop them for work life and further education. Maths, English, Languages and Science are the clear objective truths which children are taught to give them the skills and knowledge they need to understand the world. Art, Design, Music, Drama, Dance, Physical Education are all more social and creative outlets children benefit from partaking it. Both for enjoyment and for the cultural aspects of them all. Religious Education however is where people differ, some want it to push certain religions onto children, some want it to exclude religions, some don't want it at all. Most people however would side with wanting it to teach a variety religions and their practices, beliefs, customs, traditions and the like without a heavy push towards any in particular. That's what should be happening in state schools which are aimed at education the general population as it needs to reflect the needs of a diverse group of people. If you want a specific education in religion (Something that could lead to poor cultural understanding in the future) you either teach that at home, go to a special school or home school your child for it. It's not the states job to push certain religions on your children.

On the topic of sex ed, again at state schools the requirement is to cater to the diverse population they deal with. That includes Gays, Lesbians, Transexuals and naturally heterosexuals. If you don't want your kids to have a full education on the topic... Home schooling and religious schools are options. Again though you do so knowing that there will be things that they will not understand when they grow up. You have a 'right' as a parent to choose what school they go to... You have an obligation as a parent to make sure they are being taught the things they need to be, even if that includes things which go against or contradict your beliefs. You have issues in America for example where they want to remove aspects of science from them to teach creation as a truth, even thought there is no evidence to support it. Wanting to remove evolution from science classes because the bible teaches creation, completely disregarding the scientific evidence for evolution, tests, facts, peer reviewed, replicated studies and tests. This is why separation of church and state is what keeps this from happening. It stops religions going into schools and applying their beliefs to the curriculum, disregarding scientific consensus and facts.


&gt;  I'm sick and tired of this aggression

Is it aggressive though?

Let's take a step back and consider this. You're in a country and a different religion is more prominent than yours. Lets say you're a Christian and majority is Sikh. Say the split is;

* 70% Sikh
* 10% Christian
* 10% Atheist
* 10% Muslim

All the groups pay tax to the same government, all the taxes are used to fund state schools and projects. Would you be okay then with the Sikh majority being able to influence how those funds are spent? Would you be okay with them using your tax money to erect Sikh monuments on public land while disregarding the other faiths? Would you want them teaching Sikh as a true religion in schools rather than teaching a variety of religious understandings?

So the answer of is it aggressive. Nope... though I will agree terms and conditions apply:

Yes there are people who take things to far and inflict hate upon Christian groups for their beliefs as there are with every group of people. Them being dicks still doesn't make evening the playing field aggressive... that makes the people being dicks aggressive.

I can see why you might think it's ""Aggressive"" places like America and assuming Malta where you are?
In a country which has for a long time now had a heavy push towards one side (Roman Catholic if Malta, Christianity in general in the US) the levelling of the playing field leads to seemingly huge changes. Especially when you don't appear to see why other groups are upset by it.

Some cases which show importantly why separation from church and state is important can ironically be shown by Americas ""Church of Satan"" which isn't actually a church for satan. When a religious group wants to impose it's views on state ran projects, using state money or the like ""Freedom of religion"" means that the state needs to treat all religions equally. When Religion groups do that Church of Satan also puts in their application... which tends to lead to the other religion stepping down (From imposing views on state/public things) not just because it's unconstitutional to do it. But because they want a monopoly on religion and don't want the Church of Satan to be able to display their beliefs.

The whole ""Families come in all different shapes and sizes"" thing once again... everyone has different beliefs on what a family is to what the people in it what it to be. You definition of family is heavily dictated by your religious views both directly and indirectly. Many people do not share the same faith as you and thus have different views on that. Other peoples views on what family means doesn't effect your family. As long as you're happy with how you and the people you love live, other people having enjoyable lives living how they want to live (Providing now one is harming anyone) will never change your families relationship. Cultures all over the World have different meanings to family and amazingly... they do just fine. From tribes in the amazon to people in America to Russians and east Asia. The concept of family changes but the consistent theme is one of love, caring, compassion and unity. The rest is cultural differences yet they all work. Just remember that just because a belief you hold is important to you... that doesn't mean that belief is right, applies to everyone around you, is well informed, is realistic or is wrong. To apply a narrow minded belief to a world of 7+ Billion vastly under estimates how varied our species is.

69882,"&gt; Why in Hamburg of all places

This struck me as soon as I heard it would be in Hamburg. Whoever made this decision knew this would happen. Sternschanze riots are so common that ironically most people in the world don't even know about them. 2000 riot cops anywhere else in the world is front page news, out there it's just Tuesday.

I once went to Hamburg and stayed at a friends place less than 50m from Rote Flora and what I didn't know until I got there was that they had Schanzenfest that weekend. Normal street party until 21:30, by 21:45 all the street vendors have packed up and the temporary stage was dismantled and people started smashing a local bank and burning a huge pile of trash, at 22:00 literally two thousand riot cops and a few water cannons suddenly popped up. It was like it was a carefully planned schedule to the last minute. Most cafes and bars stayed open during the riots, we had beers in a bar less than 20 meters from a wall of cops and a water cannon. It was completely surreal how normal everyone was treating something that was exceptional for me. I checked the news the next day and nothing, not a single mention anywhere about something that looked like civil war to me. Since then I've been looking up information about riots in Hamburg and they happen _all the time_ and are pretty much never reported in the media.

Whoever decided that G20 should happen in Hamburg must have known about this. I don't want to sound like a conspiracy theorist, but this smells like something hugely unpopular will happen at the meeting and it was planned in riot central so that the riots would deflect attention from the politics.",europe
